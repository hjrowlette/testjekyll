<meta name="description" content="I thought I would bring back a TRIPLE RECIPE SERIES. I KNOW. FASTEN YOUR SEATBELTS 😨 First off–cauliflower gratin. This series is all about cauliflower.  There is an ongoing joke in our house about how every time our Mother buys a head of cauliflower it sits in the back of the fridge til it goes bad– and that is understandable! It’s a vegetable that can be bland and hard to pair with a main course, which is why the three recipes I have posted are so fantastic.  They do a great job of turning cauliflower from broccoli’s less-liked albino brother into a great pairing and even, dare I say, the star of the show. First up we have one of my serious favorites (and prepare yourself for this insane name) I know. It sounds insane. and it is insane. but it’s also insanely delicious and altogether pretty darn easy to make. I want to break down this recipe really quickly because it sounds super intimidating, but I promise it isn’t.  First, Brown Butter: this literally just refers to the fact that you cook the butter a little bit before you start adding the rest of the stuff for the sauce. It gives the dish an amazing, nutty flavor that complements the cauliflower so well. Second, pumpkin.  While we are in full-on autumn right now, pumpkin seems like a weird ingredient to find and use at other times of the year.  The most important part of this is that YOU DO NOT USE PUMPKIN PIE MIX. When you get the can and look at the ingredients, the ONLY  thing should be on there is pumpkin.  You can find it year round though!! I typically find it right next to the pumpkin pie mix, which does make it a little confusing. But most likely it will be in the baking aisle or where-ever else you will find canned pie fillings. The funny thing about the pumpkin is that it isn’t a super strong flavor in the dish! If you try the sauce before baking the cauliflower in it, you can definitely get a hint of it, but after it’s all been baked together I can’t really pick it out as a specific flavor.  I just think it adds a lot of creamy richness that allows you to decrease the milk and cheese you would otherwise use. Third, I think the cauliflower part of this is pretty self explanatory; its another great alternative to pasta while still providing a craving-satisfying dish.  And finally the Gratin simply is how we cook it by baking it a second time with all the sauce (that’s what makes it so yummyyyy)!! Brown Butter Pumpkin Cauliflower Gratin Ingredients 1 medium head of cauliflower, cut into small, bite sized florets 1/2 medium onion, diced or minced 2 tablespoons EVOO salt as desired 2 tablespoons butter 1/2 (15-ounce) can pureed pumpkin 1 cup shredded sharp cheddar, plus some to sprinkle on top 1 cup milk (I have made this with almond milk, 2％, and half-and-half.&nbsp; It tastes delish each way, so use whatever you have!)&nbsp; pinch of nutmeg black pepper Instructions Preheat the oven to 425F. Spread the cauliflower and onion on a baking sheet, drizzle with olive oil, and toss well to coat. Salt lightly. Roast the cauliflower and onions for 20-22 minutes, or until lightly browned and tender. While the cauliflower and onions roast, melt the butter in a large oven-proof pot (a dutch oven works well)&nbsp;over medium-high heat.&nbsp;(the one caution I have with a dutch oven is that you do need to whisk the sauce, so if you don&#39;t have a silicone whisk I would be very careful you don&#39;t scratch your dutch oven with a metal whisk. You can simply use a spoon, but a whisk definitely works best).&nbsp; Cook the butter just until it turns brown and gives off a slightly nutty smell. Be careful not to burn it, your nose is your best tool here! Add the pumpkin, then cheese, and then milk, whisking to incorporate after each ingredient. Season with the pinch of nutmeg and salt and pepper to taste. Remove the roasted cauliflower and onion from the oven.&nbsp; Add the cauliflower and onion to the sauce.&nbsp;&nbsp; Stir well to coat. If you don&#39;t have a dutch oven, move the cauliflower to an oven-safe baking dish. Top the cauliflower-cheese mixture with the reserved pinches of cheddar. Bake for 25-27 minutes, until bubbly and browned on top. Link to Original Recipe: http://brokeassgourmet.com/articles/brown-butter-pumpkin-cauliflower-gratin Well that’s what I’ve got!! If you weren’t sick of cauliflower before you might be after reading the next two posts 😁 Happy cooking!!" />
