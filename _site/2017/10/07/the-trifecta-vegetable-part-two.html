<meta name="description" content="Next in our discovery of the virtues of cauliflower, we head around the globe for some cauliflower hash! It’s a less carbed (not a real word), tasty alternative to a potato hash.  If I have cauliflower leftover from another recipe or even a smaller head, this a great recipe to throw together on the fly, especially if you pair it with a fried egg on top! If you have the time, I definitely recommend when its nearly done, take a second skillet and cook each person’s portion individually in a little salted butter–the extra space and fat helps your hash get a little more of that CRISP that defines a truly great potato hash Ingredients 2 tablespoons olive oil ¾ lb (350 g) cauliflower, chopped into small pieces 1 medium onion, diced 2-3 tsp smoked paprika (I go to town with the paprika) 1-2 tsp salt 1/2 teaspoon fresh cracked black pepper 3 large cloves garlic, minced 2 teaspoons lemon juice 2 teaspoons minced fresh parsley leaves (for garnish) Fried eggs, for serving (optional)&nbsp;(but not really)small can of hatch green chiles, jarred roasted red peppers, chopped cabbage (optional) Instructions Place a rack in lowest position; preheat oven to 450. Arrange cauliflower and onion on a rimmed baking sheet and mix with spices and oil . Season with salt and toss to evenly coat cauliflower. Optionally add green chiles, chopped roasted red peppers, or cabbage if you have it.Roast without moving until dark brown and crisp on the bottom, 15-20 minutes. Removed from oven and turn florets over. Continue to roast until second side is well sear, 15-20 more minutes.Once out of the oven, squeeze lemon juice over top.Serve with the parsley sprinkled on top, and add a fried egg if you like.
