<meta name="description" content="Three recipes in one day? Can’t stop won’t stop! I told you I had a bunch of recipes saved up, and its about darn time I was posting them! This is a fabulous spin on an old family recipe: baked cabbage, potatoes, sausage, and onion. It elevates the cabbage to be the star of the show while maintaining the ease of the original recipe because you can pretty much pop these in the oven and forget about them for almost an hour, and then they’re done! I paired this with caramelized thin-sliced onion and sausage coins which were FABULOUS, but this cabbage can certainly do the trick all by itself! Caramelized Cabbage Ingredients ¼ cup double-concentrated tomato paste 3 garlic cloves, finely grated 1½ tsp. ground coriander 1½ tsp. ground cumin 1 tsp. crushed red pepper flakes 1 medium head of green or savoy cabbage (about 2 lb. total) ½ cup extra-virgin olive oil, divided Kosher salt 3 Tbsp. chopped dill, parsley, or cilantro Full-fat Greek yogurt or sour cream (for serving) Directions 1. Preheat oven to 350°. Mix tomato paste, garlic, coriander, cumin, and red pepper flakes in a small bowl. 2. Cut cabbage in half through core. Cut each half through core into 4 wedges. 3. Heat ¼ cup oil in a large cast-iron skillet (any large skillet will work for this part) over medium-high. Working in batches if needed, add cabbage to pan cut side down and season with salt. Cook until lightly charred, about 4 minutes. Flip slices and repeat on other side, another 4 minutes or so. Transfer cabbage to a plate. 4. Pour remaining ¼ cup oil into skillet. Add spiced tomato paste and cook over medium heat, stirring frequently, until tomato paste begins to split and slightly darken, 2–3 minutes.&nbsp; 5. Nestle cabbage wedges back into skillet (they should have shrunk while browning; a bit of overlap is okay).&nbsp; If you didn&#39;t use a cast iron skillet, move tomato paste to an oven safe baking dish (9x13 or so). Place cabbage in baking dish on top of tomato paste. 6.&nbsp;Pour in enough water to come halfway up sides of pan (about 1½ cups) (if using a baking dish try and use hot water). Stir around cabbage wedges to mix, season with salt, and bring to a simmer (if you&#39;re using a baking dish don&#39;t worry about the simmer).&nbsp; 7. Transfer cabbage to oven and bake, uncovered and turning wedges halfway through, until very tender, liquid is mostly evaporated, and cabbage is caramelized around the edges, 40–50 minutes. 6. Scatter dill/herbs over cabbage. Serve with yogurt or sour cream alongside. Pairs well with sausage, onion, and potatoes." />
