<meta name="description" content="Recipe number two coming atcha fast and furious! also, YAY SOUP!  I love soup. It’s the most delicious thing on the planet, and this one knocks it out of the park. This recipe gives you all the satisfaction of a hearty broccoli cheddar soup but without the stomachache afterwards from the rich cream and cheese. The creaminess is provided by blended potato and broccoli with yogurt rather than lots of heavy cream. The cheesy croutons are a great touch if you have the time and inclination, but if you’re just looking for something to bring for lunch during the week you can skip them and the soup is still fantastic! Broccoli Cheddar Soup Ingredients 2 onions 4 garlic cloves 3 Tbsp. unsalted butter ½ tsp. crushed red pepper flakes, plus more for sprinkling&nbsp; Kosher salt Freshly ground black pepper 2 heads of broccoli 1 medium russet potato 8 oz. sharp cheddar cheese 4 thick slices rustic white bread ½ cup plain Greek yogurt Directions 1. Halve 2 onions. Peel and coarsely chop. Peel and smash 4 garlic cloves, then coarsely chop. No need to break out your best knife skills because it’s all going to get blended but try to cut everything into somewhat even pieces, so they cook at the same rate. 2. Melt 3 Tbsp. unsalted butter in a large Dutch oven or pot over medium-low heat. Add onion, garlic, and ½ tsp. red pepper flakes: season with salt and black pepper. Stir to combine, then cover pot and cook, stirring occasionally, until softened and just starting to take on color, 8–10 minutes. 3. Meanwhile, trim bottoms of 2 heads of broccoli, then peel. Separate hefty stalks from florets (the thin, little stalks attached to broccoli tops are fine to leave attached to the crowns). Set aside florets.&nbsp; 4. Coarsely chop stalks into 1&quot;–2&quot; pieces. Peel 1 medium russet potato. Coarsely chop into 1&quot;–2&quot; pieces. 5. Add broccoli stalks and potato pieces to pot and stir to coat in butter. Pour in 5 cups water, add 1 Tbsp. salt, and bring to a boil over high heat. Reduce heat to medium-low and keep at a simmer.&nbsp; 6. Cover pot and cook until broccoli stalks and potatoes are completely tender (test with a cake tester, paring knife, or fork), 20–25 minutes. 7. Meanwhile, chop reserved florets into small pieces (you can take the time to separate them into baby florets or just have at them with your chef’s knife). Grate 8 oz. sharp cheddar cheese on the large holes of a box grater. You should have about 2 1/2 cups. 8. Add half of florets to pot, cover, and cook until bright green, 3–5 minutes. Transfer to a blender, let cool for 5 minutes, and purée until smooth. Some blender advice: Don&#39;t fill your blender more than halfway—work in batches as necessary. To avoid explosions, remove the center lid from the blender and cover with a kitchen towel. I just used an immersion blender and it worked perfectly! . Return purée to pot. 9. Return to medium heat and add remaining florets. Cover pot and cook until bright green, another 3–5 minutes. Add 2 cups cheddar cheese and stir until smooth. Cover and reduce heat to low; set aside while you make the cheddar croutons. 10. Heat broiler. Broil 4 thick slices rustic white bread on a rimmed baking sheet until lightly browned (watch closely: broilers vary dramatically in power!), 2–3 minutes. Turn bread over (soft side up), then sprinkle with reserved cheddar cheese and a few flecks of red pepper flakes. Continue to broil until cheese is bubbling and browned in spots, 2–3 more minutes. 11. Remove soup from heat and stir in ½ cup plain Greek yogurt. Season generously with black pepper; taste for salt. 12. Cut cheese toasts into 1&quot; (spoon-sized!) pieces. Divide soup among bowls. Top with cheddar croutons. https://www.bonappetit.com/recipe/broccoli-cheddar-soup" />

<b>Ingredients</b><br />
<br />
<div class="MsoNormal">
2 onions<o:p></o:p></div>
<div class="MsoNormal">
4 garlic cloves<o:p></o:p></div>
<div class="MsoNormal">
3 Tbsp. unsalted butter<o:p></o:p></div>
<div class="MsoNormal">
½ tsp. crushed red pepper flakes, plus more for
sprinkling&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></div>
<div class="MsoNormal">
Kosher salt<o:p></o:p></div>
<div class="MsoNormal">
Freshly ground black pepper<o:p></o:p></div>
<div class="MsoNormal">
2 heads of broccoli<o:p></o:p></div>
<div class="MsoNormal">
1 medium russet potato<o:p></o:p></div>
<div class="MsoNormal">
8 oz. sharp cheddar cheese<o:p></o:p></div>
<div class="MsoNormal">
4 thick slices rustic white bread<o:p></o:p></div>
<div class="MsoNormal">
½ cup plain Greek yogurt<o:p></o:p></div>
<br />
<br />
<b>Directions</b><br />
<br />
<div class="MsoNormal">
1. Halve 2 onions. Peel and coarsely chop. Peel and smash 4
garlic cloves, then coarsely chop. No need to break out your best knife skills
because it’s all going to get blended but try to cut everything into somewhat
even pieces, so they cook at the same rate.<o:p></o:p></div>
<div class="MsoNormal">
<br /></div>
<div class="MsoNormal">
2. Melt 3 Tbsp. unsalted butter in a large Dutch oven or pot
over medium-low heat. Add onion, garlic, and ½ tsp. red pepper flakes: season
with salt and black pepper. Stir to combine, then cover pot and cook, stirring
occasionally, until softened and just starting to take on color, 8–10 minutes.<o:p></o:p></div>
<div class="MsoNormal">
<br /></div>
<div class="MsoNormal">
3. Meanwhile, trim bottoms of 2 heads of broccoli, then peel.
Separate hefty stalks from florets (the thin, little stalks attached to
broccoli tops are fine to leave attached to the crowns). Set aside florets.&nbsp;</div>
<div class="MsoNormal">
<br /></div>
<div class="MsoNormal">
4. Coarsely chop stalks into 1"–2" pieces. Peel 1 medium russet potato.
Coarsely chop into 1"–2" pieces.<o:p></o:p></div>
<div class="MsoNormal">
<br /></div>
<div class="MsoNormal">
5. Add broccoli stalks and potato pieces to pot and stir to
coat in butter. Pour in 5 cups water, add 1 Tbsp. salt, and bring to a boil
over high heat. Reduce heat to medium-low and keep at a simmer.&nbsp;</div>
<div class="MsoNormal">
<br /></div>
<div class="MsoNormal">
6. Cover pot and
cook until broccoli stalks and potatoes are completely tender (test with a cake
tester, paring knife, or fork), 20–25 minutes.<o:p></o:p></div>
<div class="MsoNormal">
<br /></div>
<div class="MsoNormal">
7. Meanwhile, chop reserved florets into small pieces (you can
take the time to separate them into baby florets or just have at them with your
chef’s knife). Grate 8 oz. sharp cheddar cheese on the large holes of a box
grater. You should have about 2 1/2 cups.<o:p></o:p></div>
<div class="MsoNormal">
<br /></div>
<div class="MsoNormal">
8. Add half of florets to pot, cover, and cook until bright
green, 3–5 minutes. Transfer to a blender, let cool for 5 minutes, and purée
until smooth. Some blender advice: Don't fill your blender more than
halfway—work in batches as necessary. To avoid explosions, remove the center
lid from the blender and cover with a kitchen towel. I just used an immersion blender and it worked perfectly!<o:p></o:p></div>
. Return purée to pot.<br />
<div class="MsoNormal">
<br /></div>
<div class="MsoNormal">
9. Return to medium heat and add remaining florets. Cover pot
and cook until bright green, another 3–5 minutes. Add 2 cups cheddar cheese and
stir until smooth. Cover and reduce heat to low; set aside while you make the
cheddar croutons.<o:p></o:p></div>
<div class="MsoNormal">
<br /></div>
<div class="MsoNormal">
10. Heat broiler. Broil 4 thick slices rustic white bread on a rimmed
baking sheet until lightly browned (watch closely: broilers vary dramatically
in power!), 2–3 minutes. Turn bread over (soft side up), then sprinkle with
reserved cheddar cheese and a few flecks of red pepper flakes. Continue to
broil until cheese is bubbling and browned in spots, 2–3 more minutes.<o:p></o:p></div>
<div class="MsoNormal">
<br /></div>
<div class="MsoNormal">
11. Remove soup from heat and stir in ½ cup plain Greek yogurt.
Season generously with black pepper; taste for salt.<o:p></o:p></div>
<div class="MsoNormal">
<br /></div>
<div class="MsoNormal">
12. Cut cheese toasts into 1" (spoon-sized!) pieces. Divide
soup among bowls. Top with cheddar croutons.<o:p></o:p></div>
