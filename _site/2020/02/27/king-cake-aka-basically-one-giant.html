<meta name="description" content="I’m ALIVE!!! I’ve missed you all and I have too many recipes saved up that I need to get posting! But we will start with the latest and greatest rather than the ones that have waited the longest. KING CAKE! I got to talking at work about how we have a long stretch right now without any holidays, but then started thinking about mardi gras and st patricks day and so my coworker and I made a deal; I would make a king cake (which he had never heard of!) and he would make a guinness or rum cake for st patrick’s day! I had never made a king cake before and it had been years since I have had one, but I was very excited to stretch my baking muscles in my nice new kitchen and this was a great recipe to try on. I will admit I was a day late in delivering my cake to work, but the recipe makes two so I think that it was a pretty fair trade. This recipe isn’t overly complicated, the biggest ingredient is time. Using yeast means you have two periods where the dough needs to rest and rise so I recommend making this when you have other tasks to do in the kitchen to fill up the waiting! I also think this recipe could easily be used to make cinnamon rolls if you sliced the rolled bread rather than forming the ring, and obviously you have the icing recipe to go with it already! King Cake (Mardi Gras cake, Fat Tuesday cake) NOTE: THIS MAKES 2 CAKES. HALF RECIPE IF YOU ONLY WANT ONE CAKE Ingredients Pastry: 1 cup milk 1/4 cup unsalted butter 2 (.25 ounce) packages active dry yeast 2/3 cup warm water 1/2 cup white sugar 2 eggs 1 1/2 tsp salt 1/2 tsp nutmeg&lt;div&gt;5 1/2 cups flour Filling: 1 1/2 cup packed brown sugar 1 tbsp and 2 tsp cinnamon 1 cup chopped pecans 3/4 cup flour 3/4 cup melted butter Icing: 1 1/2 cup confectioners sugar 2 tbsp water or milk splash of vanilla extract Directions 1. Scald milk by heating over medium heat until bubbles form and the milk is heated through, stirring constantly (you don’t want it to boil). &nbsp;A good temperature reference is 180°F. Remove from heat and stir in 1/4 cup of butter. &nbsp;Allow mixture to cool to room temperature. 2. In a large bowl, dissolve yeast in the warm water with 1 tablespoon of the white sugar. Let stand until creamy, about 10 minutes. 3. When yeast mixture is bubbling, add the cooled milk mixture. Whisk in the eggs. Stir in the remaining white sugar, salt and nutmeg. Beat the flour into the milk/egg mixture 1 cup at a time. When the dough has pulled together, turn it out onto a lightly floured surface and knead until smooth and elastic, about 8 to 10 minutes. 4. Lightly oil a large bowl, place the dough in the bowl and turn to coat with oil. Cover with a damp cloth or plastic wrap and let rise in a warm place until doubled in volume, about 2 hours. When risen, punch down and divide dough in half. 5. To Make Filling: Combine the brown sugar, ground cinnamon, chopped pecans, 3/4 cup flour. Pour melted butter over the cinnamon mixture and mix until crumbly. 6. Grease 2 cookie sheets or line with parchment paper. 7. Roll dough halves out into large rectangles (approximately 10x16 inches or so). Sprinkle the filling evenly over the dough and roll up each rectangle tightly like a jelly roll, beginning at the wide side. Bring the ends of each roll together to form 2 oval shaped rings. Place each ring on a prepared cookie sheet. With scissors or a knife make cuts 1/3 of the way through the rings at 1 inch intervals. Let rise in a warm spot until doubled in size, about 45 minutes. 8. Preheat oven to 375°F.&nbsp; 9. Bake in preheated oven for 25 minutes. Push plastic baby doll (if desired) into the bottom of the cake. Frost while warm with the confectioners&#39; sugar blended with 1 to 2 tablespoons of water. &lt;/div&gt;" />

To Make Filling: Combine the brown sugar, ground cinnamon, chopped
pecans, 3/4 cup flour. Pour melted butter over the cinnamon mixture and mix
until crumbly.<o:p></o:p></div>

7. Roll dough halves out into large rectangles (approximately 10x16
inches or so). Sprinkle the filling evenly over the dough and roll up each rectangle
tightly like a jelly roll, beginning at the wide side. Bring the ends of each
roll together to form 2 oval shaped rings. Place each ring on a prepared cookie
sheet. With scissors or a knife make cuts 1/3 of the way through the rings at 1
inch intervals. Let rise in a warm spot until doubled in size, about 45
minutes.<o:p></o:p></div>
