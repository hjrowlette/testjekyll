<meta name="description" content="These tacos are AMAZING. And also happen to be VEGAN. They are so good I’m making them twice within a week!! Toppings definitely make the taco and you can always throw some cheese or sour cream on if you wanted to. Dying to hear what everyone thinks once they get to making them! Here’s to a new year with lots of planet friendly food choices! Ingredients Sauce 1 green chili, such as a serrano, finely grated 1 garlic clove, finely grated 1/4 c. cashew or almond butter 3 Tbsp. fresh lime juice salt Assembly 3 garlic cloves, finely grated 1/4 c. neutral oil 2 tsp. cumin 2 tsp. smoke paprika 2 medium heads of cauliflower, cut into 1”-2” florets Salt Corn Tortillas 1small white onion, thinly sliced Sliced avocado, slices radishes, cilantro leaves and lime wedges (for serving) Directions: Using a fork, mix chile, garlic, cashew butter, lime juice and 3 Tbsp. water in a small bowl to combine; season with salt and set aside. Place a rack in lowest position; preheat oven to 450. Stir garlic, oil, cumin, and paprika in a small bowl and combine. Arrange cauliflower on a rimmed baking sheet and pour spiced oil over. Season with salt and toss to evenly coat cauliflower. Roast without moving until dark brown and crisp on the bottom, 15-20 minutes. Removed from oven and turn florets over. Continue to roast until second side is well sear, 15-20 more minutes. Working in batches heat corn tortillas in large skillet until warmed through. Smash avocado on tortillas and top with cauliflower, onion, radishes and cilantro. Serve with lime wedges for squeezing. I also picked some red onion in apple cider vinegar and it was super yummy on top! https://www.bonappetit.com/recipe/cauliflower-tacos-with-cashew-crema" />
