I’m actually not normally a huge jam person, but this was easy, tasty, and kept me from climbing the walls for like an hour so I’ll take it! Strawberry Rhubarb Jam Ingredients  3 cups (about 1 pint) strawberries, hulled and halved or quartered 5 cups (3-5 large stalks) rhubarb, cut to 1/2 inch pieces 2 cups sugar juice from 1 lemon Directions Combine all ingredients in a saucepan. Cook over medium heat until it comes to a boil. Reduce heat and keep at a gentle simmer for around an hour, stirring every few minutes. To test consistency, place a plate in the freezer. Spoon a small amount of the jam onto the cold plate, wait a minute or so, and then run your finger through the jam. If it forms small ridges rather than simply joining back together, its jammy! Honestly though, if you can’t get it to the perfect jammy consistency it’s fine. Mine was a little loose (if I had added pectin it may have been tighter) but it tastes fine and we aren’t trying to win any contests here!" />

<b>Strawberry Rhubarb Jam</b><br />
<b><br /></b>
<b>Ingredients</b><span style="font-weight: bold;">&nbsp;</span><b></b><br />
<br />
<br />
3 cups (about 1 pint) strawberries, hulled and halved or quartered<br />
5 cups (3-5 large stalks) rhubarb, cut to 1/2 inch pieces<br />
2 cups sugar<br />
juice from 1 lemon<br />
<br />
<b>Directions</b><br />
1. Combine all ingredients in a saucepan. Cook over medium heat until it comes to a boil. Reduce heat and keep at a gentle simmer for around an hour, stirring every few minutes.<br />
<br />
2. To test consistency, place a plate in the freezer. Spoon a small amount of the jam onto the cold plate, wait a minute or so, and then run your finger through the jam. If it forms small ridges rather than simply joining back together, its jammy! Honestly though, if you can't get it to the perfect jammy consistency it's fine. Mine was a little loose (if I had added pectin it may have been tighter) but it tastes fine and we aren't trying to win any contests here!<br />
