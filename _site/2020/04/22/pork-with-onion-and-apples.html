<meta name="description" content="This recipe is one that comes from Brittany in Florida.  She coached me through making it one afternoon and I fell in love!  Its short, simple, and delicious! Hunter requested the recipe from Brittany, I asked Hunter for the recipe,  Hannah has since been asking…. it is in high demand, so hence, here it is!   Brit, please edit as appopriate, I am just your pinch hitter on this one so I will need a check up :D Ingredients Pork     ( original recipe was made with a pork loin, a roast, or chops will also work, just adjust your              cooking time until the meat is tender) 1           large onion thinly sliced 2           granny smith apples peeled, cored, thinly sliced 2 Tbsp apple cider vinegar              whole grain mustard (any brown, grey mustard should do the trick )              salt and pepper              neutral oil              fresh sprig of rosemary or two teaspoons dried rosemary Directions 1.  Preheat the oven to 350F.  Heavily salt and pepper the meat ( all sides if a roast or loin, if chops, hold the salt on the second side until you are ready to flip it over) Using med high/high heat, add a couple tablespoons of olive oil or other neutral oil in a cast iron, dutch oven, or other heavy pan for searing. When your oil is hot, brown your roast until a rich brown on all sides, brown your chops on one side, salt, then brown on the other side. Work the chops in batches, to avoid crowding the pan.  After meat is browned, remove from pan. In the same pan, add your onion and apple over medium heat and cook until just wilting.  Stir in the cider vinegar, deglaze the pan and turn the heat off. It would be optional to add some apple cider/juice or a bit of white wine at this point. 4.  Coat the surface, all sides of your meat, with the mustard. Settle the meat back in the pan amongst the apple and onion. Add the rosemary to the top. Put a lid on it! Bake! Chops cooked in about an hour and were fall off the bone tender.  Roast will vary depending on the weight and if there is a bone. 2-3 lb loin may be just about an hour, 4-5 lb roast may go 1.5 hours or longer. Temp it. Toss some washed, cut potatoes with olive oil, salt and pepper and bake these on a cookie sheet in that oven as well.  Crispy delight goes great with this tender tasty pork! You’re welcome :)" />
