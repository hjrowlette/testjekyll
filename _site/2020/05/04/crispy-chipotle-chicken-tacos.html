Mexican food loves me too and I’m constantly finding and developing new recipes to try. Tomorrow IS Cinco de Mayo, ask me about the fajita marinade I’m working on!

EVOO 1 lb ground chicken (or beef or turkey) 1 yellow onion, chopped 2-3 t. chipotle chili powder (yes this IS different than normal chili powder) 2 t. smoked paprika 1 1/2 t. cumin 1 t. garlic powder 1/2 t. crushed red pepper (I use cayenne) 1/2 t. oregano salt to taste 1/4 c. chopped cilantro 12 hard shell tacos ( I recommend her homemade, see below) 2 c. shredded mexican cheese Cilantro Lime Ranch:&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;(THIS IS HANNAH. I HAVE HIJACKED THE POST. WE HAVE MADE AND DO NOT ENJOY THE CILANTRO LIME RANCH. I RECOMMEND AVOCADO CREMA INSTEAD) :) goodbye 1 c. sour cream or greek yogurt 1/2 c. fresh cilantro, finely chopped 1 t. garlic powder 1 t. onion powder 1/4 c. pickled jalapenos, chopped + 2 T. brine Juice from 2 limes Salt Instructions: Preheat oven to 425. In large skillet heat EVOO over high heat. When oil is hot add chicken and onion. Cook breaking up meat as it cooks, until chicken is browned, about 5 minutes.  Add spices and salt. Add 3/4 c. water and reduce meat to medium and simmer until sauce has thickened slightly around chicken, about 10 minutes. Remove from heat and stir in 1/4 c. cilantro. *EASY HOMEMADE SHELLS Warm 8-12 corn tortillas for 30 seconds to 1 minutes in microwave, until pliable. On a baking sheet, rub tortillas with olive oil. Lay each flat and then layer evenly with cheese and chicken. Fold the other half of the tortilla over the filling, gently pushing to adhere. Transfer to oven and bake for 5-8 minutes, then flip and cook 5 minutes more, or until cheese has melted and tortillas are crisp. Meanwhile, make the ranch. Combine all ingredients in glass jar, or blender, and mix to combine until creamy. Adjust salt. Serve with final taco. Add some avocado, and serve with any remaining cilantro. Leftover diced jalapeno? Add that too!!  I’m a huge fan of some quick pickled red onion slices. But that’s a blog post for another time….Serve with Mexican rice and a salad and it’s a show folks. You know how it goes folks, try it riff it, and get back to me. Until next time, Happy eating! https://www.halfbakedharvest.com/chipotle-chicken-tacos/ &lt;/div&gt;" />
