<meta name="description" content="THESE ARE THE CUTEST THING YOU&#39;LL EVER MAKE, I PROMISE. They are&nbsp;so cute and so easy, and no special equipment required. I&#39;ve never made dumplings before and this was so simple and enjoyable! These are super tasty day of, as leftovers, and can be frozen and cooked from the freezer, so I highly recommend making a double batch and freezing some :)Pork and Scallion DumplingsIngredients8 oz ground pork8 scallions (2 tbsp thinly sliced, rest are coarsely chopped)1&quot; piece ginger2 tsp plus 2 tbsp soy sauce (divided)1 tsp kosher salt, divided1/2 tsp fresh ground white or black pepper24 3 1/2&quot;-diameter wonton wrappers5 tbsp rice vinegar, divided4 tsp AP flour4 tsp cornstarch6-8 tsp veg oil2 tsp chili oil (optional but highly recommend)Directions1. set aside 2 tbsp thinly sliced scallions2. Place 8 oz pork in a medium bowl, and add coarsely chopped scallions.3. Peel and finely grate ginger into bowl with the pork4. Add 2 tsp soy sauce, 3/4 tsp salt, and 1/2 tsp pepper to the pork. Mix to combine all ingredients5. Prepare to form dumplings (below directions are for square wrappers, if you have round wrappers find a youtube video lol). place wonton wrappers on work surface and cover with a damp towel. Place a small bowl of water nearby.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ehEJKV5wmXk&amp;t=2s6. PLEASE USE THE GRAPHIC OR YOUTUBE VIDEO, ITS HARD TO EXPLAIN IN WORDS OKAY. Place 1 wrapper in palm of your nondominant hand. Scoop a round teaspoonful of filling and place in center of wrapper. Dip finger of dominant hand in water and moisten two sides of your square wrapper. Fold across to join edges, forming a triangle. Firmly seal the edges, pushing out any excess air.Note: Poorly sealed dumplings will leak, and dumplings with air trapped could explode. So like, actually do that last step.&nbsp;7. Lightly wet one end corner of your triangle (not the middle corner). Pull the two end corners down and together to line up with your center corner. Place the dry corner on top of the wet corner and press lightly to adhere the two.&nbsp; When you&#39;re sufficiently confused, follow the youtube video lol.8. Repeat for all remaining dumplings. At this point, if you want to freeze any dumplings place on a baking tray and leave in freezer for 12 hours to solidify. Then, store in an airtight bag until ready to use. When using frozen dumplings, follow same instructions as below.9.&nbsp; Mix slurry for dumplings by whisking 3 tbsp rice vinegar, 4 tsp flour, 4 tsp cornstarch, remaining 1/4 tsp salt, and 2 cups water in large measuring glass.10. Heat 2 tsp vegetable oil in large nonstick skillet over medium-high heat. Arrange 6-10 dumplings in pan, and cook 1 minute until barely sizzling (you don&#39;t want them taking on color).&nbsp;11.Stir slurry well and add a generous 1/2 cup to pan. Cover and steam dumplings for 5 minutes. Dumplings should be plumped, and most of water evaporated. Cover and cook a minute longer if needed.12. Uncover dumplings and cook until all liquid is evaporated and the slurry becomes a crisp, golden brown skirt (about 2-4 minutes).&nbsp; You may need to rotate your pan to ensure even coloring.13. Break apart slurry skirt so each dumpling has a little portion. Repeat cooking process with remaining dumplings and slurry; make sure to stir the slurry before each batch, and add 2 tsp vegetable oil to pan after each batch.14. While dumplings are cooking, make dipping sauce. Combine 2 tsp chili oil, 2 tbsp rice vinegar, and 2 tbsp soy sauce to the reserved thinly sliced scallions, and mix well.&nbsp;&nbsp;" />
