<meta name="description" content="I’ve decided we need more breakfast on here! I’ll be honest, I’m not normally a big breakfast person–a cup of coffee and an orange or apple is usually all I eat, unless its a special occasion. But hey, in quarantine every day kinda seems like a special occasion! I’ll preface this recipe by saying I’ve never cooked matzo before. I’ve eaten it, and I know it can be used to make an assortment of delicious things, but I decided to try this recipe on a whim. One of my favorite stand up comedians, Iliza Shlesinger, started an Instagram cooking show called #Don’tPanicPantry with her husband, Noah Galuten. What’s significant about that? Mr. Noah (aka Smokey Husky) is a professional chef and kinda knows his way around the kitchen! If you get a chance to watch them you absolutely should–they have posted all sorts of awesome recipes, but I especially love this one because its crazy easy, crazy fast, and crazy good. The way that advertised it is that it tastes like french toast, and I’ll say this now–I am not a french toast fan. but this? For some reason I found this fabulous! Matzo Brei itself is pretty neutral and can actually be used in sweet or savory dishes. I tried it with a drizzle of maple syrup for breakfast, but I’m already having visions of this topped with dressed greens for a quick and tasty dinner! Anyways I’ll quit gabbing, my intro is longer than the recipe will be! Matzo Brei Serves 2 Ingredients 3 sheets matzo (I used salted, GF) 3 eggs splash of milk 2 tbsp butter salt -optional- vanilla extract Maple syrup for serving Directions In a wide, shallow dish lightly beat eggs. Add splash of milk, and stir to incorporate. (I added a splash of vanilla extract since I was doing the sweet breakfasty version!) Run matzo sheets briefly under cold water to moisten, then break into roughly one inch pieces. Place all pieces in dish with egg mixture, and stir to incorporate. Let set for 2 minutes to fully soften Heat large nonstick skillet over medium-high heat. Add butter and wait for it to melt and get foamy in the pan. Pour the entire egg and matzo mixture into the skillet, spreading across the whole surface of the skillet. Season lightly with salt. Let cook undisturbed for 3-4 minutes or however long it takes for the bottom to get browned (medium, not light but not black either) and crispy. Flip over (I broke mine in half to make it easier to flip).  Season other side lightly with salt. Let cook until brown and crispy. Plate, and drizzle lightly with maple syrup. Alternatively, skip the vanilla and maple syrup and top with whatever savory toppings come to mind!" />
