<meta name="description" content="Howdy there! How’s everyone doing? Surviving this crazy virus that has taken over all aspects of our life? Hopefully you’re practicing good health habits, socially distancing, and taking care of yourself! I know it seems like a weird time to be posting a party punch recipe when we are supposed to be 6 feet away from each other at all times but hey, this can’t last forever! And when things start getting back to normal you better believe I’m gonna be throwing a party to celebrate :D There are a million and one party punch recipes on facebook, instagram, pinterest, or whatever social media site is your favorite, but I think this one is super easy, appeals to a lot of people, and contains stuff you can find easily at any grocery store. Because lets be honest, some of those pinterest recipes can get a little…whacky sounding. The other thing I like about this recipe is that you can make it alcoholic or non-alcoholic based on your preference, and you can also easily adjust how much alcohol by simply swapping the sierra mist for champagne for a lighter drink, or adding vodka for an extra punch! One final note: this is our inaugural drink recipe on the blog! CAN YOU BELIEVE THAT? 75 recipes in, and this is our first sippy one–how awesome! All Occasion Party Punch (Alcoholic or Non-Alcoholic!) Serves 12-16 Ingredients 2 L sprite (or champagne) 64 oz (standard size bottle) cranberry juice 52 oz (standard size bottle) orange juice 1 cup vodka (if you desire) (I used equal parts raspberry and lime) 1 cup triple sec (if you desire) I would note if you don&#39;t use champagne but do use vodka, you can add up to 3 cups of vodka. If you use champagne and vodka I recommend using only the volumes of vodka listed above so that you can, you know, still stand after a glass of it Directions Mix together cranberry, orange juice, and vodka (if you desire) Add sprite or champagne just before serving Serve over ice. Garnish with fresh orange slices" />
