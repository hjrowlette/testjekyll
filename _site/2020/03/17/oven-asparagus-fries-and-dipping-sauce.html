<meta name="description" content="I have a confession. I mean not really, I’m just being dramatic. I LOVE ASPARAGUS. I LOVE IT SO MUCH. I COULD EAT IT ALL THE TIME. Anyways, I came across this recipe in a costco magazine of all places and thought it sounded delish, and let me tell you, IT IS. IT”S SO GOOD. ALL ASPARAGUS IS SO GOOD. ahem. I definitely made a couple of mods from the original but this is, while messy to assemble, relatively quick and uses a lot of pantry/fridge staples! enjoy! Asparagus Fries and Spicy Dipping Sauce Ingredients 1 cup panko 3/4 cup parmesan cheese, grated 1/4 cup flour dash of paprika salt 2 eggs 1 lb fresh asparagus, rinsed and ends trimmed 1/4 cup mayo 2 garlic cloves, grated or minced 1 tsp lemon juice 1 tsp paprika 1/2 tsp cayenne pepper 1/4 cup greek yogurt Directions Preheat oven to 425F. Lightly spray a baking sheet with nonstick spray. In a shallow wide dish, combine panko and parmesan Sift flour into a second shallow, wide dish. Whisk eggs into a third shallow, wide dish. Working in batches, coat asparagus in flour (rinsing aparagus helps flour to stick). Dredge flour coated asparagus in egg mixture, then panko mixture, pressing to coat. Place coated asparagus on the prepared baking sheet in a single layer. Bake 10-12 minutes, or until golden brown and crisp. For the sauce, mix all ingredients except yogurt in a small bowl. Gently mix in yogurt just until combined." />
