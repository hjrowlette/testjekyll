<meta name="description" content="boom! Just like that another recipe! and this time, its a drink recipe! We don’t have too many of those so I’m excited to expand! I will preface this recipe by saying it is WORK IN PROGRESS. I only make it in the fall when we go apple picking and I’m up to my eyes in apples. Thus, I tweak it every time I make it, and I’m not convinced this is the final version. However, it helps me keep track of where I’m at with it, and what sort of steps I took the year previously. Apple Cider Ingredients 10-12 apples, cored (not peeled) and quartered 2 oranges, peeled and quartered 4 cinnamon sticks 16 cups of water 1 whole nutmeg 2 tsp whole cloves 2 tsp whole allspice 1 inch fresh ginger, scrubbed and sliced 1/2 cup maple syrup 1/4 cup brown sugar Directions Add all ingredients except the maple syrup and brown sugar to a large stock pot. Make sure you have an inch or two of headspace at the top of your pot. Heat over high heat and bring to a boil. Reduce to medium-low, cover, and simmer for around two hours, until apples are completely soft. Mash apples and oranges to release additional juice/flavor, then cover and simmer for another hour. Strain out solids starting with a larger mesh sieve and working down to a fine-mesh sieve or even cheese cloth. A few notes: I usually do one pass with a large sieve to remove the solids, then one to two passes with a fine mesh sieve to remove any smaller apple solids. When using the fine mesh sieve, try not to press the liquid through the sieve; it will push through grittier solid bits that prevent your cider from having a smooth texture. Instead, swirl the liquid to encourage it to pass through the sieve, and rinse/empty your sieve regularly to get those small-grain apple solids out of the way. Return to heat and add sweetener to taste (above are only guidelines, you could use honey or white sugar!) Serve warm or refrigerate. It will last a few weeks in the fridge or can be frozen. Whenever you want to serve, thaw or rewarm on the stove.  You can garnish with orange slices and cinnamon stick, and pair with splash whiskey for a kick!" />

<a name='more'></a><b>Apple Cider</b><br />
<b>Ingredients</b><br />
10-12 apples, cored (not peeled) and quartered<br />
2 oranges, peeled and quartered<br />
4 cinnamon sticks<br />
16 cups of water<br />
1 whole nutmeg<br />
2 tsp whole cloves<br />
2 tsp whole allspice<br />
1 inch fresh ginger, scrubbed and sliced<br />
1/2 cup maple syrup<br />
1/4 cup brown sugar<br />
<b><br /></b>
<b>Directions</b><br />
1. Add all ingredients except the maple syrup and brown sugar to a large stock pot. Make sure you have an inch or two of headspace at the top of your pot.<br />
<br />
2. Heat over high heat and bring to a boil. Reduce to medium-low, cover, and simmer for around two hours, until apples are completely soft.<br />
<br />
3. Mash apples and oranges to release additional juice/flavor, then cover and simmer for another hour.<br />
<br />
4. Strain out solids starting with a larger mesh sieve and working down to a fine-mesh sieve or even cheese cloth.<br />
<br />
A few notes: I usually do one pass with a large sieve to remove the solids, then one to two passes with a fine mesh sieve to remove any smaller apple solids. When using the fine mesh sieve, try not to press the liquid through the sieve; it will push through grittier solid bits that prevent your cider from having a smooth texture. Instead, swirl the liquid to encourage it to pass through the sieve, and rinse/empty your sieve regularly to get those small-grain apple solids out of the way.<br />
<br />
5. Return to heat and add sweetener to taste (above are only guidelines, you could use honey or white sugar!)<br />
<br />
6. Serve warm or refrigerate. It will last a few weeks in the fridge or can be frozen. Whenever you want to serve, thaw or rewarm on the stove.&nbsp; You can garnish with orange slices and cinnamon stick, and pair with splash whiskey for a kick!
