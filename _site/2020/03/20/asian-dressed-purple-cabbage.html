<meta name="description" content="Happy Friday everyone! I’m sifting through the final nests of mess that remained after my move, and lo and behold I uncovered a few handwritten recipes I’ve made but never got around to posting here. Unfortunately its been a while since I’ve made these so I don’t have photos, but next time I do I will add them! Asian-Dressed Purple Cabbage Slaw Ingredients 4 tbsp soy sauce 4 tbsp oil (I used half sesame, half EVOO) 1 tbsp honey 1 tsp lemon juice 2 tbsp rice vinegar 1 clove garlic, grated 1 2-inch piece of ginger, grated 1 cup shredded carrot 2 scallions, thinly sliced 2-4 cups finely sliced purple cabbage Directions Stir together all ingredients but the carrot, scallion, and purple cabbage in a small bowl. Mix carrot, scallion, and purple cabbage in a large bowl. Pour dressing on top, and stir to combine. This tastes best after it marinates for a few hours, but doesnt do so well after a few days in the fridge. Could be used as a side, put on top of fish tacos or burgers, or a number of other things!" />
