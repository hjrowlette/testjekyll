<meta name="description" content="Good Evening my Cookie Friends! I don’t know, I’ve run out of ideas for intros because I’ve posted so many recipes lately! Anyways, I’ll say one benefit from spending all my time at home is that I’m n ot only trying new recipes, but I’m also getting the posted up on the blog! This pancakes sound a little odd, I know. And I won’t lie to you, they look a little strange while they’re cooking. What this dish requires is faith–faith in the fact that at the end of the day pancakes are always amazing, and faith that scallions make everything better ;) This recipe isn’t naturally gluten free but could easily be made with a Gluten Free cup-for-cup substitute flour! This would also make a great appetizer if you did a bunch of smaller pancakes. Scallion Pancakes with Chili-Ginger Dipping Sauce makes 4-6 pancakes Ingredients Sauce 1 1/2” piece of ginger, peeled and thinly sliced 2 tbsp soy sauce 2 tbsp rice vinegar 1 tsp chili oil 1 tsp sugar Pancakes 1 cup all-purpose flour (could easily use GF flour) 1/4 cup cornstarch 1 tsp kosher salt 1 tsp sugar 1 cup chilled club soda 2 tsp soy sauce 1 tsp sesame oil 10 scallions, thinly sliced on the diagonal (around 2 cups) 4 tbsp vegetable oil Directions Sauce Whisk ginger, soy sauce, vinegar, chili oil, and sugar in a small bowl until sugar is dissolved. Set aside Pancakes Whisk flour, cornstarch, salt, and sugar in a large bowl. Whisk club soda, soy sauce, and sesame oil in a medium bowl to combine, then pour into large bowl with dry ingredients. Whisk together until smooth (be careful not to over-mix; its okay if there are a few small lumps). Fold in scallions. Head 1 tbsp oil in a medium nonstick skillet over medium-high heat. Pour a heaping 1/4 cup batter into skillet. Cook until bottom of pancake is set and golden, about 2 minutes. Once it has initially set you can move the pancake around the pan to help it cook evenly.  Flip and cook, lightly pressing until other side is also golden, another minute or two. Continue cooking, turning often to keep the scallions from burning, until golden brown and crisp, and cooked through, about 5 minutes longer. Transfer to a wire rack or place on a paper towel lined plate. Repeat with remaining batter and remaining 3 tbsp oil, adding 1 tbsp of oil before each new pancake." />
