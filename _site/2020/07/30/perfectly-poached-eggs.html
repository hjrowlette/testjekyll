<meta name="description" content="Well Hello!&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Yet again time has gotten away from me, and I have failed to post a new recipe in far too long! To be fair, work has been keeping me quite busy and as a result I’ve been doing a lot of Sunday meal prep to feed me for the week, which unfortunately doesn’t lend itself to wildly creative cooking. BUT, this recipe (if it even qualifies) is one that I’ve been meaning to do for a while, and is one that both Britt and Mom have requested. How to poach an egg. Poaching an egg can be the easiest or the most frustrating thing in the world, and everyone has their own set of tips and tricks to make it go well.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Like many others, I’ve tried a lot of different ways and I am definitely not saying that my way is best, but it certainly works the most regularly for me and I think is a little easier than some of the other tips out there (looking at you hurricane!)&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Without further ado, this is my guide to poaching an egg!&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;separator&quot; style=&quot;clear: both; text-align: center;&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;-Fresh eggs are helpful; you can certainly use older eggs, but it can go a little better if your eggs are fresh (the main reason for that is the next bullet)&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;-I recommend sieving your egg through a fine mesh sieve. All you do is crack the egg into your sieve and let the loose egg whites drip out. Give it more time than you think it may need and trust me, you won’t lose all your egg white when you do this! What sloughs off when you sieve the egg is what otherwise turns into the annoying white wisps as you try to poach them. I have found you are more likely to have looser egg whites (and thus more wisps) with older eggs than fresher eggs, but regardless of how old your eggs are, SIEVE THEM!&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;-Place each sieved egg in its own ramekin so you can gently ease each egg into the water&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;-No vinegar, salt, or magic powder is required. Just a shallow, wider pot of water (a couple of inches deep)!&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;-Place your pot of water over high heat and bring it to a boil (quel gasp!). I know it sounds counter intuitive to nearly every poaching instruction that directs a gentle simmer, but I really struggled finding the balance of having water that is either too cool or too hot, and this method eliminates that problem. Once your pot comes to a boil, turn off the heat and wait 30-60 seconds for the water to stop bubbling and cool a bit. Then, with the heat off, one by one ease your eggs into the pot of water. After your eggs have formed a bit, gently loosen them with a spoon to ensure they aren’t sticking to your pan. &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;-Wait 2 minutes (or until the eggs appear fully cooked), and then remove from water with a slotted spoon. Gently pat dry with a paper towel and place on your plate.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;-If you wish to store your poached eggs for eating later (whether that be in 2 hours or the next day), immediately place them in an ice bath rather than drying them. Store them in cool water until you are ready to eat, and just before serving reheat them in a pot of warmed water for roughly 30 seconds. This is very useful for cooking a larger quantity of poached eggs, or for making Eggs Benedict. &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;-my final note is that if you plan on poaching more than 4 eggs, I would do it in two batches. The main reason is that it does take time to gently ease each egg into the pot after the water has boiled, and the more eggs you’re doing the more time it takes so your later eggs may not be cooked enough. It’s much easier to wait after the first four, reheat your water, and do a second round! &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;And that’s it! Give it a shot, I hope its helpful for you and if not let me know what you have found that is more useful!&lt;/div&gt;" />
