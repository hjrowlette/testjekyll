<meta name="description" content="Happy Halloween my witchy pals!! It&#39;s been awhile but I thought what better way to pop back into the site than with a dose of healthy(ish) chocolate heaven!! I&#39;ve made this zucchini bread recipe a couple times now and it is absolutely mind-blowing. It has a lot less sugar than other zucchini bread recipes I&#39;ve tried, and it has more zucchini, which are the two reasons I&#39;m claiming it&#39;s &quot;healthy&quot;. Only thing I changed in this recipe is that I switched out the cinnamon for a teaspoon of espresso powder instead. &nbsp;I am a firm convert in the beauty of how a little coffee accents chocolate beautifully; you can pick between cinnamon or espresso powder though, because either will be delicious!! I&#39;ve included the link below and it has one of those snazzy Facebook feed videos, but you can also just see the recipe as well! Enjoy&nbsp; (: Death by Chocolate Zucchini Bread INGREDIENTS 1/2 c. melted butter, plus more for brushing pan 1/2 c. cocoa powder, plus more for dusting pan 1 1/4 c. all-purpose flour 1 tsp. baking soda 1 tsp. cinnamon or espresso powder 1/4 tsp. kosher salt 1 c. sugar 1 egg plus 1 egg yolk 1 tsp. vanilla extract 2 c. grated zucchini (from 1 large or 2-3 small) 2/3 c. chocolate chips DIRECTIONS 1. Preheat oven to 350 degrees F. Butter and dust a loaf pan with cocoa powder. 2. In medium bowl, whisk together flour, cocoa powder, baking soda, cinnamon, and salt. 3.

Add zucchini, then add flour mixture in 3 additions. Fold in chocolate chips. 4.Transfer batter to prepared dish and bake 50 minutes. 5.
