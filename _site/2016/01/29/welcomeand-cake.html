<meta name="description" content="Hello to Pascale and Brittany who have been roped into my mother’s and my crazy plan-you cannot escape our madness. We were chatting today about how we are always talking about recipes that we want to share with each other but its hard to keep them all in one place or to be able to go back and find them again–solution? WE MADE A BLOG BECAUSE WE ARE SUPER NERDS!!!! So my mom (if she can figure out how to do so (I BELIEVE IN YOU MA!)) is going to be posting a pork loin recipe later fingers crossed, and I am inaugurating this blog with the thing that we all, well mostly, love most: CAKE Below is the link for a chocolate cake recipe that I made for nat’s birthday back in september, and ever since I made it we have been talking about having a chocolate cake-off with a different homemade chocolate cake recipe she made for Hunter’s birthday last April. I didn’t get to try Hunter’s cake, but I think that the recipe I made is gonna be pretty hard to beat. Anyways if this cake battle comes to fruition we will have to post pictures and winners, but until then here is a fantastic chocolate cake recipe that I recommend! Love to you all and happy cooking!! And yes, I absolutely included these pictures just to make your mouths water ;) http://addapinch.com/cooking/the-best-chocolate-cake-recipe-ever/ https://addapinch.com/perfect-chocolate-buttercream-frosting-recipe/ CHOCOLATE CAKE RECIPE Ingredients 2 cups all-purpose flour 2 cups sugar 3/4 cup unsweetened cocoa powder 2 teaspoons baking powder 1 1/2 teaspoons baking soda 1 teaspoon salt 1 teaspoon espresso powder 1 cup milk buttermilk, almond, or coconut milk 1/2 cup vegetable canola oil, or melted coconut oil 2 large eggs 2 teaspoons vanilla extract 1 cup boiling water Chocolate Buttercream Frosting Recipe (see below) Instructions 1. Preheat oven to 350º F. Prepare two 9-inch cake pans by spraying with baking spray or buttering and lightly flouring. 2. Add flour, sugar, cocoa, baking powder, baking soda, salt and espresso powder to a large bowl or the bowl of a stand mixer. Whisk through to combine or, using your paddle attachment, stir through flour mixture until combined well. 3. Add milk, vegetable oil, eggs, and vanilla to flour mixture and mix together on medium speed until well combined. Reduce speed and carefully add boiling water to the cake batter until well combined. 4. Distribute cake batter evenly between the two prepared cake pans. Bake for 30-35 minutes, until a toothpick or cake tester inserted in the center of the chocolate cake comes out clean. 5. Remove from the oven and allow to cool for about 10 minutes, remove from the pan and cool completely. 6. Frost cake with Chocolate Buttercream Frosting. Notes The cake batter will be very thin after adding the boiling water. This is correct and results in the most delicious and moist chocolate cake I&#39;ve ever tasted! xo Freezer Friendly Let the baked cake layers cool completely. Wrap them well with plastic wrap and then with foil. Put each layer into a freezer bag and freeze up to 2 months. To serve, thaw in the refrigerator overnight. The next day, the layers are ready to fill and frost. CHOCOLATE BUTTERCREAM RECIPE Ingredients 1½ cups butter 3 sticks, softened 1 cup unsweetened cocoa 5 cups confectioner’s sugar ½ cup milk 2 teaspoons vanilla extract ½ teaspoon espresso powder Instructions 1. Add cocoa to a large bowl or bowl of stand mixer. Whisk through to remove any lumps. 2. Cream together butter and cocoa powder until well-combined. 3. Add sugar and milk to cocoa mixture by adding 1 cup of sugar followed by about a tablespoon of milk. After each addition has been combined, turn mixer onto a high speed for about a minute. Repeat until all sugar and milk have been added. 4. Add vanilla extract and espresso powder and combine well. 5. If frosting appears too dry, add more milk, a tablespoon at a time until it reaches the right consistency. If it appears to wet and does not hold its form, add more confectioner’s sugar, a tablespoon at a time until it reaches the right consistency." />

Chocolate Buttercream Frosting Recipe (see below)<o:p></o:p></div>
<div class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: normal; margin-bottom: .0001pt; margin-bottom: 0in;">
<br /></div>
<div class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: normal; margin-bottom: .0001pt; margin-bottom: 0in;">
<b style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;">Instructions<o:p></o:p></b></div>
<div class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: normal; margin-bottom: .0001pt; margin-bottom: 0in;">
<br /></div>
<div class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: normal; margin-bottom: .0001pt; margin-bottom: 0in;">
1. Preheat oven to 350º F. Prepare two 9-inch cake pans by spraying
with baking spray or buttering and lightly flouring.<o:p></o:p></div>
<div class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: normal; margin-bottom: .0001pt; margin-bottom: 0in;">
<br /></div>
<div class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: normal; margin-bottom: .0001pt; margin-bottom: 0in;">
2. Add flour, sugar, cocoa, baking powder, baking soda, salt and
espresso powder to a large bowl or the bowl of a stand mixer. Whisk through to
combine or, using your paddle attachment, stir through flour mixture until
combined well.<o:p></o:p></div>
<div class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: normal; margin-bottom: .0001pt; margin-bottom: 0in;">
<br /></div>
<div class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: normal; margin-bottom: .0001pt; margin-bottom: 0in;">
3. Add milk, vegetable oil, eggs, and vanilla to flour mixture and mix
together on medium speed until well combined. Reduce speed and carefully add
boiling water to the cake batter until well combined.<o:p></o:p></div>
<div class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: normal; margin-bottom: .0001pt; margin-bottom: 0in;">
<br /></div>
<div class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: normal; margin-bottom: .0001pt; margin-bottom: 0in;">
4. Distribute cake batter evenly between the two prepared cake pans.
Bake for 30-35 minutes, until a toothpick or cake tester inserted in the center
of the chocolate cake comes out clean.<o:p></o:p></div>
<div class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: normal; margin-bottom: .0001pt; margin-bottom: 0in;">
<br /></div>
<div class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: normal; margin-bottom: .0001pt; margin-bottom: 0in;">
5. Remove from the oven and allow to cool for about 10 minutes, remove
from the pan and cool completely.<o:p></o:p></div>
<div class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: normal; margin-bottom: .0001pt; margin-bottom: 0in;">
<br /></div>
<div class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: normal; margin-bottom: .0001pt; margin-bottom: 0in;">
6. Frost cake with Chocolate Buttercream Frosting.<o:p></o:p></div>
<div class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: normal; margin-bottom: .0001pt; margin-bottom: 0in;">
<br /></div>
<div class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: normal; margin-bottom: .0001pt; margin-bottom: 0in;">
Notes<o:p></o:p></div>
<div class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: normal; margin-bottom: .0001pt; margin-bottom: 0in;">
The cake batter will be very thin after adding the boiling water. This
is correct and results in the most delicious and moist chocolate cake I've ever
tasted! xo<o:p></o:p></div>
