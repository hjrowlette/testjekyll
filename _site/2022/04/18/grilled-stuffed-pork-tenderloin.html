<meta name="description" content="Grilled Stuffed Pork Tenderloin - Pol Martin Cook Book&nbsp; Stuffing: 3 Tbs butter 1/2 stalk celery, diced 1/2 onion, chopped 1/2 tsp rosemary 1 Tbsp fresh basil, chopped 6 fresh mushrooms, chopped 2 Tbs. Madeira Wine (or Red) 1/2 cup. breadcrumbs (GF optional) salt and pepper Directions: Heat butter in sauté pan over medium heat. Add celery and onion; cook 5 minutes over low heat. Add rosemary, basil, salt and pepper and cook 2 minutes over medium heat. Add mushrooms; continue cooking 4 minutes. Add wine and cook another 2 minutes. Mix in breadcrumbs and cook 1 minute. Remove from heat and transfer mixture to food processor; blend 30 seconds. Taste and adjust salt and pepper.&nbsp; Remaining Ingredients: 2 medium pork tenderloins fat removed 1 Tbsp. olive oil 1 tsp teriyaki sauce Juice of 1 lemon Salt and pepper Directions:&nbsp; Cut each tenderloin open lengthwise to prepare for stuffing. Do not cut through the entire thickness of the meat. Place opened tenderloins between sheets of waxed paper (or plastic wrap). Pound with mallet to flatten. Spread stuffing over tenderloins, roll and secure with string. Mix oil, teriyaki sauce, lemon juice, salt and pepper together. Brush mixture over pork. Preheat barbecue at medium. Oil grill and add stuff tenderloins. Cover and cook 30 minutes. Season to taste and turn tenderloins over 2 to 3 times during cooking. Baste 5 to 6 times with oil mixture. BRITTANY NOTES: I only use one tenderloin, last time I made this I actually used a pork roast and made extra stuffing. Pounding out the meat isn&#39;t that bad, use the flat side of a meat tenderizer or the bottom of a pan. I try to roll the pork so it ends up even on both ends and in the middle, so I&#39;m not married to rolling it length or width ways, I just want it to cook evenly. Be sure to salt and pepper all sides of the meat before and after you stuff it. We grill with charcoal (we&#39;re not heathens), we placed the charcoal in the baskets and set up the grill for indirect heat. We started with 4 minutes and rotated to all four sides as best we could. Basting in between. I think it took a total of 35 minutes on the grill, and we let it rest in a warm oven to make sure it was cooked through. A meat thermometer is absolutely required to make sure the middle isn&#39;t raw! If the outside is getting too cooked or burnt and the middle needs more time, place in a 350 oven and check temp every 5-7 minutes. There&#39;s nothing wrong with starting on the grill and finishing in the oven. I quite like this method! Especially for very thick or stuffed meat. Be sure to let rest when finished before carving. Until next time, happy eating!" />
