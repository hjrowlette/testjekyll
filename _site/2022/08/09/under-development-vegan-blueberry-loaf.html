<meta name="description" content="&nbsp;Howdy! So I&#39;m jumping the gun and posting this now, but its a make at your own risk! I&#39;m still fine tuning the recipe. It&#39;s based off a cookie recipe that I made, but I didn&#39;t really like how the cookies themselves came out. I was trying to figure out what needed to change to improve the recipe, and I realized cookies just weren&#39;t the right way to do it! And so the blueberry loaf is born. I also wanted to add a lemon glaze to give it a citrusy punch as well; I had added lemon zest to the cookies but it just didn&#39;t shine through, so I think the glaze will really help bring in that citrus element better! I&#39;m not sure if this recipe is big enough to fill a loaf tin right now, and I&#39;m unsure on oven temps and baking times but as soon as I test this out I&#39;ll update the recipe with what I&#39;ve learned!

    <p>&nbsp;Howdy! So I'm jumping the gun and posting this now, but its a make at your own risk! I'm still fine tuning the recipe. It's based off a cookie recipe that I made, but I didn't really like how the cookies themselves came out. I was trying to figure out what needed to change to improve the recipe, and I realized cookies just weren't the right way to do it! And so the blueberry loaf is born. I also wanted to add a lemon glaze to give it a citrusy punch as well; I had added lemon zest to the cookies but it just didn't shine through, so I think the glaze will really help bring in that citrus element better!</p><p>I'm not sure if this recipe is big enough to fill a loaf tin right now, and I'm unsure on oven temps and baking times but as soon as I test this out I'll update the recipe with what I've learned!</p><p><br /></p><p></p><p class="MsoNormal"><b>Ingredients</b><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class="MsoNormal">135 grams all-purpose flour (about 1 cup)<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class="MsoNormal">1/2 tsp baking powder<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class="MsoNormal">1/8 tsp salt<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class="MsoNormal">76 grams unsalted vegan butter, softened (about 1/3 cup)<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class="MsoNormal">90 grams granulated sugar (about 1/3 cup and 1 tbsp)<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class="MsoNormal">80 grams frozen blueberries (about 1/3 cup)<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class="MsoNormal">70 grams white chocolate chips, chopped (about 1/2 cup)<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><br /></p><p class="MsoNormal"><b>Instructions</b><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class="MsoNormal">1. Preheat your oven to 400F. Line a loaf tin with parchment paper.<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class="MsoNormal">2. In a small bowl, whisk together the flour, baking powder and
salt.<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class="MsoNormal">3. Either in the microwave or on the stovetop, thaw the frozen
blueberries until they are soft and jammy. In the microwave this should take
about 30 seconds on high heat, and on the stovetop it should take about 2-3
minutes on medium heat.<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class="MsoNormal">4. Let the blueberries cool for about 2-3 minutes. While they
are cooling, use an electric mixer or a stand mixer to cream together the
butter and sugar. You want to cream the sugar and butter until the mixture is
noticeably lighter and fluffy.<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class="MsoNormal">5. Add the blueberries to the butter and sugar and cream at a
high speed. You want to essentially "mash" the blueberries into the
mixture, making it so that they are pureéd and fully combined with the butter
and sugar. The mixture should be a deep purple color.&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class="MsoNormal">6. Gradually fold the dry ingredients in with the wet
ingredients to form a dough. Mix in the white chocolate chips.<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class="MsoNormal">7. Pour mixture into parchment-lined loaf tin. Bake for 40 minutes (TOTAL ESTIMATE) or until a knife comes out clean)</p><p class="MsoNormal">8. While the loaf is baking, combine powdered sugar and lemon juice in a bowl and whisk to combine. Add additional lemon juice to reach desired consistency.</p><p class="MsoNormal">9. When loaf comes out of oven, let cool for 5-10 minutes then brush or drizzle glaze on top of the loaf.</p><br /><p></p>
