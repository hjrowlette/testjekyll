<meta name="description" content="Classic French Macarons You’ve made it!! You (hopefully read) the three other posts that probably contained more information than you could ever want to read about macarons, and now you’re ready to begin making a batch! Below is the recipe I use when making macarons–depending on how large you make your cookies, you can get anywhere from 18-30+ sandwiches (2 cookies per sandwich remember!) from this recipe Ingredients -2 egg whites (roughly 65g) -1/4 tsp cream of tartar -55g granulated sugar -100g superfine almond flour -100g powdered sugar -flavoring (recommend starting at 1/2 tsp for extracts, adjust as needed) -food coloring (gel only)&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;(if you are making chocolate cookies, substitute 10-15g of almond flour for the cocoa powder, total should still be 100g between the two) Filling Recipe: See Part 3 Macaron Directions Set out eggs to reach room temperature 2. Mark parchment paper to form a 2” x 2” grid. ALTERNATIVELY, print out a macaron template and place under a sheet of parchment paper. Place parchment paper on baking sheet and set aside. (You will likely need 1-2 large baking sheets). 3. Sift almond flour and icing sugar through a fine mesh sieve into a bowl together. Set aside. 4. Place egg whites and cream of tartar in a large bowl (ensure your bowl, beaters, and spatula are immaculately clean and dry), and beat on medium speed until foamy. While beating, gradually add granulated sugar until fully incorporated.&nbsp; Increase speed to high and beat until stiff peaks form. (see part 1) 5. Add any extract or food coloring to egg whites and beat for another 30 seconds to incorporate. 6. Add all of sifted almond flour and icing sugar into meringue. Fold dry ingredients into meringue until fully incorporated (should take 30-40 strokes) using macaronage technique (see part 2). Your macaron mixture should have a texture similar to lava. 7. Place macaron mixture in piping bag that’s fitted with a 1/3” round tip. Pipe evenly sized macarons into the grid you’ve marked on the parchment paper. When piping, fill nearly to the edge of the template circle and then cease pressure on the piping bag before gently swirling and removing your piping tip from the cookie to prevent vertical tips in your cookies. 8. Drop the baking sheet straight down onto the counter several times to settle the cookies and pop air bubbles. Use a toothpick to pop and additional air bubbles. If you wish to place any decorations on the top of your cookies (crushed freeze dried raspberries, candy cane crumbs, sprinkles, etc) do so now. 9. Let cookies rest for 20-30 minutes to allow a skin to form on the top of the cookies. This ensures your feet will rise vertically. If baking in a humid room, it may take longer for the skin to form. You will know the skin has formed because you can tap the top of the cookie with your finger and will have no residue on your finger 10. While cookies rest, preheat oven to 300°&nbsp;F. 11. Place cookie tray in oven and bake 7 minutes. After 7 minutes, open oven door to release steam, close door, and continue baking for 6-7 more minutes.&nbsp; NOTE: If you are making larger macarons, they will take longer. If your cookies are browning, they are overbaked.&nbsp;When fully baked, cookies should have raised to form little feet and shouldn’t move when gently tapped. 12. Pull parchment paper from baking sheet and set on cooling rack or directly on kitchen counter, and let cookies cool COMPLETELY for at least 30 minutes. After this they should easily release from parchment paper. If they do not release, place back in oven and bake until done. 13. While your cookies rest prior to baking and are in the oven, follow chosen filling recipe instructions.&nbsp;&nbsp; 14.&nbsp;After filling is ready and cookies have cooled, pipe filling onto half of the macaron cookies you have made. Place other half of the cookies on top to form a sandwich, twisting or pushing lightly to help bond the halves. 15. Place cookies in airtight container and refrigerate overnight or for 24 hours before serving. Can be stored in an airtight, refrigerated container for up to 7 days. &lt;/div&gt;" />

    Classic French Macarons<br />
<br />
You've made it!! You (hopefully read) the three other posts that probably contained more information than you could ever want to read about macarons, and now you're ready to begin making a batch! Below is the recipe I use when making macarons--depending on how large you make your cookies, you can get anywhere from 18-30+ sandwiches (2 cookies per sandwich remember!) from this recipe<br />
<br />
<a name='more'></a><br />
<br />
<u>Ingredients</u><br />
-2 egg whites (roughly 65g)<br />
-1/4 tsp cream of tartar<br />
-55g granulated sugar<br />
-100g superfine almond flour<br />
-100g powdered sugar<br />
-flavoring (recommend starting at 1/2 tsp for extracts, adjust as needed)<br />
-food coloring (gel only)<div><br /></div><div>(if you are making chocolate cookies, substitute 10-15g of almond flour for the cocoa powder, total should still be 100g between the two)<br />
<br />
Filling Recipe: See Part 3<br />
<br />
<br />

<u>Macaron
Directions</u></div>
<div class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 6pt;">
</div>
<ol></ol>
1. Set out eggs to reach room temperature<br />
<div>
<br />
2. Mark parchment paper to form a 2” x 2” grid.
ALTERNATIVELY, print out a macaron template and place under a sheet of
parchment paper. Place parchment paper on baking sheet and set aside. (You will likely
need 1-2 large baking sheets).</div>
<div>

<div>
<br />
3. Sift almond flour and icing sugar
through a fine mesh sieve into a bowl together. Set aside.</div>
<div>
<br />
4. Place egg whites and cream of tartar in a large
bowl (ensure your bowl, beaters, and spatula are immaculately clean and dry), and beat on medium speed until foamy. While beating, gradually add granulated sugar until fully incorporated.<span style="text-indent: -0.25in;">&nbsp; </span><span style="text-indent: -0.25in;">Increase
speed to high and beat until stiff peaks form. (see part 1)</span></div>
<div>
<div style="text-indent: -24px;">
<br /></div>
5. Add any extract or food coloring to egg whites and beat for another 30 seconds to incorporate.<br />
<div>

6. Add all of sifted almond flour and icing sugar into meringue. Fold dry ingredients into meringue until fully incorporated (should take 30-40
strokes) using macaronage technique (see part 2).<br />
Your macaron mixture should have a texture similar to lava.</div>
<div>
<br />
7. Place macaron mixture in piping bag that’s
fitted with a 1/3” round tip. Pipe evenly sized macarons into the grid you’ve
marked on the parchment paper. When piping, fill nearly to the edge of the template circle and then cease pressure on the piping bag before gently swirling and removing your piping tip from the cookie to prevent vertical tips in your cookies.<br />

8. Drop the baking sheet straight down onto the counter several times to settle
the cookies and pop air bubbles. Use a toothpick to pop and additional air bubbles. If you wish to place any decorations on the top of your cookies (crushed freeze dried raspberries, candy cane crumbs, sprinkles, etc) do so now.</div>
<div>
<br />
9. Let cookies rest for 20-30 minutes to allow a skin to form on the top of the cookies. This ensures your feet will rise vertically. If baking in a humid room, it may take longer for the skin to form. You will know the skin has formed because you can tap the top of the cookie with your finger and will have no residue on your finger</div>

10. While cookies rest, p<span style="text-indent: -0.25in;">reheat oven to 300</span><span face="&quot;arial&quot; , sans-serif" style="text-indent: -0.25in;">°</span><span style="text-indent: -0.25in;">&nbsp;F.</span></div>
<div>
<div style="text-indent: -24px;">
<br /></div>
11. Place cookie tray in oven and bake 7 minutes. After 7 minutes, open oven door to release steam, close door, and continue baking for
6-7 more minutes.<span style="text-indent: -0.25in;">&nbsp; NOTE: If you are making larger macarons, they will take longer. If your cookies are browning, they are overbaked.&nbsp;</span><span style="text-indent: -0.25in;">When fully baked, cookies
should have raised to form little feet and shouldn’t move when gently tapped.</span></div>
<div>
<div style="text-indent: -24px;">
<br /></div>
12. Pull parchment paper from baking sheet and set
on cooling rack or directly on kitchen counter, and let cookies cool COMPLETELY
for at least 30 minutes. After this they should easily release from parchment
paper. If they do not release, place back in oven and bake until done.</div>
<div>
<br />
13. While your cookies rest prior to baking and are in the oven, follow chosen filling recipe instructions.<span style="text-indent: -0.25in;">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></div>
<div>
<span style="text-indent: -0.25in;"><br /></span></div>
<div>
<span style="text-indent: -0.25in;">14.&nbsp;</span><span style="text-indent: -0.25in;">After filling is ready and cookies have cooled, pipe
filling onto half of the macaron cookies you have made. Place other half of the cookies on top
to form a sandwich, twisting or pushing lightly to help bond the halves.</span></div>
<br />
<div>
15. Place cookies in airtight container and
refrigerate overnight or for 24 hours before serving. Can be stored in an
airtight, refrigerated container for up to 7 days.</div><div><br /></div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/a/AVvXsEi6b3HB7l9SYSkdzt9T2AtGo4Ew3AuzJXuz81OWJM7KejBZMI0noQYh1B7Tw-lBz2ZLXdDGRdiLpgrCFN7fvp35ttnY3-axxRGYBVqBTG-vftfNAZuB8JhqTUiSGp30lCyW3kjA9lNH6VatLBtzsPSfNscGZbYZWa42nX0scANhsEouhvgLfc9v7OAfwg=s4032" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" data-original-height="4032" data-original-width="3024" height="320" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/a/AVvXsEi6b3HB7l9SYSkdzt9T2AtGo4Ew3AuzJXuz81OWJM7KejBZMI0noQYh1B7Tw-lBz2ZLXdDGRdiLpgrCFN7fvp35ttnY3-axxRGYBVqBTG-vftfNAZuB8JhqTUiSGp30lCyW3kjA9lNH6VatLBtzsPSfNscGZbYZWa42nX0scANhsEouhvgLfc9v7OAfwg=s320" width="240" /></a></div><br /><div><br /></div>
