<meta name="description" content="The fillings are to me the simplest part of the macaron, but you want them to be a home run so that your picky little cookies have a filling that do them justice :) I wouldn’t say there are really any special techniques to making fillings, so below are just some recipes for your consideration when making macarons! The two main macaron fillings are ganache or buttercreams, and can be customized as you want. I want to specify that I haven’t test driven this ganache recipe with anything other than semisweet chocolate, so if you want to try white chocolate or milk I would do some research to make sure it’ll work. I also want to clarify that I’m not completely sold on this ganache recipe yet.  Using different ratios of cream to chocolate yield very different textures of ganache, so I may experiment with different options and will update this post with more info, or make an entirely new post about ganache alone! -Update- I have ventured into the magical world of infused buttercreams, and let me tell you, it is pretty cool! I made a rose macaron with fresh sage buttercream, and it was incredible.  I’ll include a few steps below on how to make the infused butter in case you want to try it out! Buttercream Filling 110g unsalted butter, room temperature (roughly 1 stick) 200-250g powdered sugar, sifted 2-3 tbsp liquid (milk, juice, or other infusion) Food coloring or extract flavoring 1.  Beat butter for at least 3 minutes until volume has increased and the color is nearly white 2.  Add powdered sugar in 2-3 increments, beating for 2 minutes after each incorporation. 3.  Gradually add liquid of choice until buttercream has reached a spreadable and pipeable consistency 4.  Add food coloring as needed. Use immediately or store in an airtight container in the fridge.  To use after fridge, thaw on countertop and then beat again for a few minutes to regain proper texture.  Can be frozen–thaw in fridge and then follow those directions. Infused Butter1. Take one stick of unsalted butter, melt in a small saucepan over low heat on the stove, then add roughly chopped fresh herb of your choosing (I used a 3/4 ounce package).2. Remove from heat and let mixture set at room temperature for about an hour; taste the butter to ensure it has picked up enough of the herb flavor.3. Strain through a fine mesh sieve to remove leaves, and refrigerate to set. Follow rest of buttercream recipe. Raspberry/Berry Sauce&nbsp; (to add to buttercream) 8oz of raspberry or other berry (I have successfully used strawberry and blackberry) 2 tbsp lemon 1 tbsp granulated sugar 1.&nbsp; Add all ingredients to small saucepan 2.&nbsp; Cook over medium heat for 4-6 minutes until berries have broken down and juice has thickened 3.&nbsp; Remove saucepan from heat and press berry mixture through fine mesh sieve, discarding the solids and retaining the juice 4.&nbsp; Allow to cool to room temp, then use for liquid (2-3 tablespoons) in buttercream recipe Can be refrigerated and frozen (I would imagine). Chocolate Ganache (makes enough for a double recipe of macaron filling) Ingredients: -3/4 cup heavy whipping cream -6oz semisweet chocolate, chopped *other flavoring 1.&nbsp; Add all heavy cream to small saucepan and turn heat to medium. 2.&nbsp; Allow cream to heat only until small bubbles are forming on the side of the pan, constantly stirring to prevent cream from burning. 3.&nbsp; Remove from heat and add all the chopped chocolate to the saucepan.&nbsp; Stir to mix in the chocolate and then let sit undisturbed for 3-5 minutes so the chocolate can melt. 4. Whisk or stir mixture to fully combine cream and chocolate. 5. Allow to cool to room temp so that the ganache thickens to a pipeable consistency that will hold its shape, stirring every so often. Depending on how warm your kitchen is, this can take up to 30 minutes. I don&#39;t recommend speeding the cooling process in a fridge. *While I haven&#39;t yet tried it, I believe you can easily add other flavoring like coffee (whether in liquid or instant espresso) or liquor (like baileys or kahlua).&nbsp; If you are adding liquor, I would decrease at least a little bit the amount of cream you use to ensure your ratio of chocolate to liquid doesn&#39;t get off-balance.&nbsp; I want to try this out soon so I&#39;ll let you know how it goes! https://www.handletheheat.com/how-to-make-chocolate-ganache/" />
