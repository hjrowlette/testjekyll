<meta name="description" content="It’s finally here–the post(s) you have all been waiting for!! MACARONS! Despite the title, I am still far from an expert in these picky cookies, but I am happy to share the recipe I use and the lessons I have learned in hopes to aid your own culinary journey to the perfect macaron.  I decided to break this up a bit because I think there is a lot of interesting history and information to make your macaron journey easier.  My plan right now is to split macarons into a few posts–this post focuses on meringues, one on the composition of the cookie, one on fillings, and one straight recipe post that can be your go-to reference! Macarons are tricky for a few reasons, firstly because of its requirement for meringue.  Meringue on paper is relatively simple–you take egg whites, add sugar (more on that in a bit) and you beat them until the proteins in the egg white denature and you get this lovely, shiny, white marshmallowy substance that is sweet and airy.  The trouble with meringues is their pickiness–anything from a vestige of egg yolk, a bit of fat leftover in your mixing bowl, or soap/water traces from the last time you washed the bowl can prevent the whites from properly whipping to the necessary stiff peaks. I can tell you that it is absolutely maddening to sit there beating your egg whites to death with no avail while all your other macaron ingredients sit there laughing at your (I mean they ARE french cookies and a snotty bunch to boot). SCIENCE! of Meringue There are three main ingredients in a meringue recipe that interact to form the foam structure: egg whites, sugar, and cream of tartar or acid. The backbone of the foam structure is made up of proteins, amino acid chains. Egg whites provide the meringue with necessary proteins that form the meringue foam. The proteins are originally oriented in a tangled ball but must be uncoiled into strands; this is referred to as denaturation. There are two ways a protein can be denatured, through physical or chemical process. When forming a meringue the egg whites are beaten until the proteins are denatured, a physical process.  Lemon curd tart with Italian meringue topping that has been lightly torched Also by beating the egg whites, air is incorporated into the protein structure creating an air-water protein mixture interface. The friction from beating the eggs adds heat to the process, which causes the proteins to increase in elasticity. As the proteins are being stretched during the denaturation process they are also coagulating together forming a protein network. After the denaturation process the egg whites will become six to eight times their original size. If the proteins are beat for too long they will become stretched out too far and become too weak to support the foam structure. No I didn’t write this science-specific insanity, I shamelessly stole it from someone else cough WIKIPEDIA cough. Types of Meringue  There are three types of meringues that can be used to make macarons, and their differences relate to how you incorporate the sugar into the egg whites. They are French, Swiss, and Italian. French meringue is made with room temperature egg whites and granulated sugar (plus cream of tartar), and is most friendly to home cooks like us who don’t have quite the level of equipment and expertise of pastry chefs. However, it is the least stable of the three types of meringue. When I say stable, I am referring to the literal consistency of your meringue.  If you were to pipe french meringue, it wouldn’t hold the shape of whatever tip you use; however something like an Italian meringue is much more stable and can be used atop cakes or tarts in beautiful design (see the picture to the left). Swiss meringue also uses egg whites and granulated sugar; however it is made atop a bain-marie, or warm water bath, that helps stabilize and cook the egg whites. Swiss meringue typically requires both a digital thermometer as well as a stand mixer in order to maintain the correct temperature of the egg whites and to beat them to stiff peaks easily. Italian meringue is made with egg whites and a boiling sugar syrup rather than plain granulated sugar.  It is the most stable form of meringue and is most safe to eat as well. Italian meringue absolutely requires a digital thermometer and would be incredibly difficult to make without a stand mixer, as you must carefully stream the hot sugar mixture down the side of you mixing bowl as you whip your egg whites. If you incorporate the sugar syrup too quickly or pour it directly on the egg whites rather than down the side of the bowl, your egg whites will not whip properly. Meringue cookies, typically made from French meringue Speaking of safe to eat, that is another distinction between the three types of meringues.  Italian meringue, typically used as a pie or tart topping, is completely safe to consume as the temperature of the egg whites is raised enough by your sugar syrup to eliminate any potential salmonella bacteria.  Swiss meringue is more safe than french meringue for the same reason that it is actually heated (although not as hot as the italian meringue).  HOWEVER, salmonella risks are relatively low in the US, and it is more likely for the bacteria to be found in the yolk of the egg than the egg white, and the presence of sugar in meringue additionally inhibits the bacteria. That’s why I feel comfortable using french meringue when making macarons. Other Meringue Desserts It is typically held that french meringue make the best meringue cookies (not to be confused with macaron cookies) because they end up with a light and crisp texture you miss if you make cookies from swiss or italian meringue, when you have already heated your egg whites in those recipes prior to baking the cookies themselves. Meringues can also be used as a basis for buttercreams that are beautifully airy and delicately sweet compared to American buttercreams.  For meringue buttercreams, italian or swiss meringue is much more common due to their increased stability. Meringues in Macarons Below are some tips on french meringues since that it what I use for macarons: Everything you use should be scrupulously clean.&nbsp; I will always wash the bowl I plan on using for meringue just prior to use and then dry it with paper towels to prevent as much as possible any fat, dish soap, or water traces being in the bowl. If you have whisk attachments for your mixer, use them! It will take much less time for you to incorporate air into your egg whites than with typical beater attachments, although regular beater attachments will work fine (they just take longer). Your egg whites (especially for french meringue) need to be room temperature. They WILL NOT whip up properly if they are straight from the fridge. For french meringue, beat your egg whites between foaminess and soft peaks before beginning to add sugar. This allows the proteins in the egg whites to begin to unfold a little faster and easier before you introduce sugar. Do not rush adding the sugar for french meringue.&nbsp; You want the sugar to dissolve as much as possible as you whip the egg whites, so add the sugar slowly and in small increments to allow time for this to happen. however, you do want it all incorporated prior to reaching stiff peaks.&nbsp; A good test is to take a small bit of meringue and rub it between your fingers--you want to feel little to no grittiness from the sugar granules in the meringue. Have everything else for your macarons ready to go--french meringue is an impatient fellow.&nbsp; Make sure all your other ingredients are ready before you begin to whip your meringue or you risk it deflating or going runny while sifting almond flour and prepping other ingredients Wait to add food color and any flavoring to the end.&nbsp; Once you have reached your beautiful and glossy stiff peaks, add any food coloring (gel only!) and small amount of liquid flavoring (vanilla, peppermint, etc) and beat for another 30 seconds to incorporate In the next post I’ll discuss the actual composition of the sandwich cookie beyond just meringue, including information about almond flour and the infamous macronnage technique that takes a weird lumpy mess of almond flour and meringue and turns it into the lava batter that makes a perfectly textured macaron. As motivation for this series, below is a picture of some macarons to keep you motivated and working towards the end goal!" />

<span style="color: #222222;"><span style="font-family: inherit;">Also by beating the egg whites, air is incorporated into the protein structure creating an air-water protein mixture interface. The friction from beating the eggs adds heat to the process, which causes the proteins to increase in elasticity. As the proteins are being stretched during the denaturation process they are also coagulating together forming a protein network. After the denaturation process the egg whites will become six to eight times their original size. If the proteins are beat for too long they will become stretched out too far and become too weak to support the foam structure. No I didn't write this science-specific insanity, I shamelessly stole it from someone else *cough* WIKIPEDIA *cough*.</span></span><br />

<b>Types of Meringue&nbsp;</b><br />
There are three types of meringues that can be used to make macarons, and their differences relate to how you incorporate the sugar into the egg whites. They are French, Swiss, and Italian.<br />
<br />
French meringue is made with room temperature egg whites and granulated sugar (plus cream of tartar), and is most friendly to home cooks like us who don't have quite the level of equipment and expertise of pastry chefs. However, it is the least stable of the three types of meringue. When I say stable, I am referring to the literal consistency of your meringue.&nbsp; If you were to pipe french meringue, it wouldn't hold the shape of whatever tip you use; however something like an Italian meringue is much more stable and can be used atop cakes or tarts in beautiful design (see the picture to the left).<br />
<br />Swiss meringue also uses egg whites and granulated sugar; however it is made atop a&nbsp;bain-marie, or warm water bath, that helps stabilize and cook the egg whites. Swiss meringue typically requires both a digital thermometer as well as a stand mixer in order to maintain the correct temperature of the egg whites and to beat them to stiff peaks easily.<br />
<br />
Italian meringue is made with egg whites and a boiling sugar syrup rather than plain granulated sugar.&nbsp; It is the most stable form of meringue and is most safe to eat as well. Italian meringue absolutely requires a digital thermometer and would be incredibly difficult to make without a stand mixer, as you must carefully stream the hot sugar mixture down the side of you mixing bowl as you whip your egg whites. If you incorporate the sugar syrup too quickly or pour it directly on the egg whites rather than down the side of the bowl, your egg whites will not whip properly.<br />

Speaking of safe to eat, that is another distinction between the three types of meringues.&nbsp; Italian meringue, typically used as a pie or tart topping, is completely safe to consume as the temperature of the egg whites is raised enough by your sugar syrup to eliminate any potential salmonella bacteria.&nbsp; Swiss meringue is more safe than french meringue for the same reason that it is actually heated (although not as hot as the italian meringue).&nbsp; HOWEVER, salmonella risks are relatively low in the US, and it is more likely for the bacteria to be found in the yolk of the egg than the egg white, and the presence of sugar in meringue additionally inhibits the bacteria. That's why I feel comfortable using french meringue when making macarons.<br />
<br />
<b>Other Meringue Desserts</b><br />
It is typically held that french meringue make the best meringue cookies (not to be confused with macaron cookies) because they end up with a light and crisp texture you miss if you make cookies from swiss or italian meringue, when you have already heated your egg whites in those recipes prior to baking the cookies themselves.<br />
<br />
Meringues can also be used as a basis for buttercreams that are beautifully airy and delicately sweet compared to American buttercreams.&nbsp; For meringue buttercreams, italian or swiss meringue is much more common due to their increased stability.<br />
<br />
<b>Meringues in Macarons</b><br />
Below are some tips on french meringues since that it what I use for macarons:<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<li>Everything you use should be scrupulously clean.&nbsp; I will always wash the bowl I plan on using for meringue just prior to use and then dry it with paper towels to prevent as much as possible any fat, dish soap, or water traces being in the bowl.</li>
<li>If you have whisk attachments for your mixer, use them! It will take much less time for you to incorporate air into your egg whites than with typical beater attachments, although regular beater attachments will work fine (they just take longer).</li>
<li>Your egg whites (especially for french meringue) need to be room temperature. They WILL NOT whip up properly if they are straight from the fridge.</li>
<li>For french meringue, beat your egg whites between foaminess and soft peaks before beginning to add sugar. This allows the proteins in the egg whites to begin to unfold a little faster and easier before you introduce sugar.</li>
<li>Do not rush adding the sugar for french meringue.&nbsp; You want the sugar to dissolve as much as possible as you whip the egg whites, so add the sugar slowly and in small increments to allow time for this to happen. however, you do want it all incorporated prior to reaching stiff peaks.&nbsp; A good test is to take a small bit of meringue and rub it between your fingers--you want to feel little to no grittiness from the sugar granules in the meringue.</li>
<li>Have everything else for your macarons ready to go--french meringue is an impatient fellow.&nbsp; Make sure all your other ingredients are ready before you begin to whip your meringue or you risk it deflating or going runny while sifting almond flour and prepping other ingredients</li>
<li>Wait to add food color and any flavoring to the end.&nbsp; Once you have reached your beautiful and glossy stiff peaks, add any food coloring (gel only!) and small amount of liquid flavoring (vanilla, peppermint, etc) and beat for another 30 seconds to incorporate</li>

In the next post I'll discuss the actual composition of the sandwich cookie beyond just meringue, including information about almond flour and the infamous macronnage technique that takes a weird lumpy mess of almond flour and meringue and turns it into the lava batter that makes a perfectly textured macaron. As motivation for this series, below is a picture of some macarons to keep you motivated and working towards the end goal!<br />
