I tend to alter the dessert recipes I try, which is why they usually end up handwritten rather than a straight link, and why there is no macaron or pate a choux recipe link.  I would definitely like to get those uploaded another day though!  Applesauce https://cookieandkate.com/&lt;/wbr&gt;2017/how-to-make-applesauce/ Buche de Noel https://www.bonappetit.com/&lt;/wbr&gt;recipe/buche-de-noel-recipe Gingerbread Glue https://food52.com/recipes/&lt;/wbr&gt;32341-gingerbread-house-glue Modelling Chocolate https://sugargeekshow.com/recipe/modeling-chocolate-recipe/ Apple Cider&nbsp; (only note I have is that after I sieved everything, I put it back on the stove to cook down a bit further) Also you definitely need a fine-mesh sieve for this, otherwise you will have a granular texture to your cider https://www.allrecipes.com/recipe/211772/homemade-apple-cider/ Other things I have for you are our go-to gingerbread recipe (doubling it makes a disgusting amount of gingerbread so maybe stick with a single or time and a half recipe) as well as a ratio recipe for buttercream.&nbsp; I have been completely converted by this pastry chef in england, and its her buttercream ratio that I use for all buttercreams I make.&nbsp; Raspberry, chocolate, vanilla--it doesn&#39;t matter. If you follow the golden ratio and the guidelines I have also included, you should be able to produce a buttercream that has you floating on a cloud of light, sweet, and balanced sugary heaven that is perfect for macarons, cakes, or anything else that buttercream is used for :) The amounts that are listed aren&#39;t enough to do an entire cake (should be enough for 1 dozen cupcakes though), but in the near future I&#39;m going to be hunting for the ultimate from-scratch vanilla cake recipe and I will figure out the amounts needed for a standard two layer cake and let you know! Buttercream 150g unsalted butter, soft 340g icing sugar, sifted 3-4 tbsp whole milk/milk infusion/juice/other liquid&nbsp; Guidelines: your butter must be room temp. That doesn&#39;t mean stick it in the microwave until its half melted, it means set it out on the counter before bed or first thing in the morning and use it that afternoon or evening.&nbsp; Obviously how long it takes to soften depends on the temperature in your kitchen, but if you have the stove on for something else, setting your buttercream nearby will definitely speed the process.&nbsp; If your butter goes too soft (it will have an oily sheen at this point) stick it back in the fridge for a few minutes to firm up Sift your icing sugar--no one likes lumpy buttercream. :) BEAT YOUR BUTTER. BEAT IT LIKE IT STOLE MONEY FROM YOU AND THEN KICKED AN ELDERLY PERSON AS IT RAN AWAY.&nbsp; To get the right texture of super light and creamy, you want to spend at least 5 minutes beating your butter&nbsp;to incorporate air.&nbsp; It should increase in volume and change colors to be much lighter after this. Add all your powdered sugar in two to three increments, beating for 3-5 minutes between increments.&nbsp; This allows additional time for air to incorporate and ensures the sugar gets evenly incorporated.
