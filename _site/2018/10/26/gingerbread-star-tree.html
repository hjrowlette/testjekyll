<meta name="description" content=" Hello All! I wanted to include a quick post about a template I used last year to make a beautiful gingerbread star tree holiday decoration for Christmastime since it will be here before you know it! My mother and I are getting geared up for our annual gingerbread nightmare (aka contest), and I’m sure you will be getting updates on that whole process until we get it turned in! But if you aren’t feeling as ambitious as us crazies, this is a super easy, customizable, and cute decoration that can last the entire holiday season. The template I used for my star tree a PDF at the link below–all you have to do is make a batch of your favorite gingerbread recipe, print off the PDF pages and cut out the stars, and then cut out the stars from your gingerbread using the numbers required in the template! Gingerbread Star Tree Template A tip for construction, which is the ‘most difficult’ part (it still isn’t that bad) (1) definitely decorate before you construct (2) glue together (with caramel or icing) your stars of the same size into mini stacks before you combine your mini stacks into the entire tree.  It will make the overall construction seem easier to do it in small sections. (3) don’t rush your construction–take time to make sure your same-size stars are all aligned as you make your mini stacks, and make sure all the ministacks are lining up correctly as you stack them–it will make it more secure and less nerve-wracking! The link is also below with the gingerbread glue recipe we used last year, it was a beautiful bright white and made for clean lines and strong construction–this stuff wasn’t going anywhere! Gingerbread ‘Glue’ Royal Icing The one note is while this is absolutely edible, it will get dried out and stale after a week or two I would say.  But if its just for decoration as mine was, it can sit and pretty up your kitchen for several weeks! Pictures of mine are the ones included, I went for classic and simple christmas colors but I may try and change it up this year and do something a little more adventurous!" />

The template I used for my star tree a PDF at the link below--all you have to do is make a batch of your favorite gingerbread recipe, print off the PDF pages and cut out the stars, and then cut out the stars from your gingerbread using the numbers required in the template!<br />

<br />
A tip for construction, which is the 'most difficult' part (it still isn't that bad)<br />
(1) definitely decorate before you construct<br />
(2) glue together (with caramel or icing) your stars of the same size into mini stacks before you combine your mini stacks into the entire tree.&nbsp; It will make the overall construction seem easier to do it in small sections.<br />
