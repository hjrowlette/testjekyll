<meta name="description" content="&nbsp;Just as it says in the title, this recipe is a super delicious breakfast or dinner option with a ton of spinach that comes together pretty easily! If you have time, caramelize the onions. If not? It&#39;ll still be great! Definitely could add more seasoning to give it depth, but as is its simple, rich and delicious. This was born from me having a ridiculous amount of spinach and needing to use it, so it&#39;s great if you have extra greens lying about. You could easily add some other vegetables, just make sure they&#39;re mostly cooked before throwing them in. Enjoy! Spinach Egg Bake" />

<p class="MsoNormal"><b>Ingredients<o:p></o:p></b></p>

<p class="MsoNormal">1 – 1 1/2 pounds of spinach<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class="MsoNormal">1 onion, thinly sliced (mandoline recommended)<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class="MsoNormal">1 heaping cup Swiss, gruyere, or other cheese shredded<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class="MsoNormal">1/4 cup Parmesan cheese, grated<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class="MsoNormal">1/2 cup scallions, thinly sliced<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class="MsoNormal">1 1/2 cups bread, cubed<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class="MsoNormal">5 eggs<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class="MsoNormal">1 1/4 cup milk<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class="MsoNormal">Salt and pepper<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><b>Directions<o:p></o:p></b></p>

<p class="MsoNormal">1. In a large pot, cook and thoroughly drain spinach. You
can cook in EVOO and season with salt and pepper, and additional seasonings you
may like. <span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp;</span>Drain very well, and then chop
on a cutting board.<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class="MsoNormal">2. Once spinach is done, put onion in empty pot, season with
salt, and cook onions down until soft or all the way until caramelized
depending on how much time you have. Deglaze with water or white wine if
necessary.<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class="MsoNormal">3. Combine swiss or gruyere, parmesan, green onions, cooked spinach,
onions, and bread in a bowl. Season well with salt and pepper. In a separate
bowl combine the milk and eggs and season well with salt and pepper.&nbsp;</p><p class="MsoNormal">4. Pour milk
and eggs into bowl with spinach mixture, then pour combined mixture into a
greased 2-quart baking dish (7x11 worked perfectly for me).&nbsp;</p><p class="MsoNormal">5. Cover and bake at
375F for 20 minutes. Uncover and bake another 10 minutes, or until the dish is jiggly
but set. Let cool 7-10 minutes before slicing and serving. Enjoy!<o:p></o:p></p>
