<meta name="description" content="&nbsp;Welcome, welcome one and all! Today, we have a fabulous show in store. So sit back and relax and enjoy the ride...&nbsp; And what is that ride you may ask? Well, this series of posts will be called &quot;Britt&#39;s Bites,&quot; the idea is that by labeling all the posts this way you&#39;ll know what you&#39;re getting into before you click. And what exactly are you getting into? A quick trip into the chaos of my brain when I&#39;m cooking something new. These aren&#39;t going to be polished posts. Sometimes, when I&#39;m trying things for the first time, I&#39;m compounding several recipes I&#39;ve seen online in additional to techniques and flavors I already know. Sometimes, I&#39;m following a wild idea and have no clue what I&#39;m doing.&nbsp; Freestyling in the kitchen, is something I&#39;ve really come to enjoy. And Michael and I have both reaped the benefits! I&#39;m proud of what I&#39;ve done, and I&#39;m excited to share it with you. These posts should be interpreted as guidelines, not a hard and fast recipe. I’ve been trying to get into the habit of writing things down after I’ve cooked and eaten, so the next time I want to repeat something, I have a rough idea of what I did and how I can improve. Often, I don’t measure when I’m cooking. So when I’m writing the recipe down after the fact, its a rough estimate of what I’ve done. Sometimes I go back to make something again and I’ll realize I definitely missed a step, or mis-measured something.&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As I post these, I’ll try to update them with any additional notes I’ve made and categorize by date. I hope these are helpful, and give you a fun look into what’s happening in my kitchen. Please interpret wildly and don’t be afraid to edit a post and pop something down that you’ve tried. I’d love to know when you try something and what you think!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Until then, enjoy this series and as always, Happy Eating! &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;" />
