<meta name="description" content="&nbsp;This is a recipe from Britt... A fridge staple which is wonderful to cook your eggs in, or add to cooked greens or a soup, drizzled on avocado toast.&nbsp; This has great flavor, without too much heat, definitely a family fave! Please feel free to edit this Britt, just getting a start to it !&nbsp; We need the website this came from... I cannot remember, perhaps you can add it? Ingredients 1 1/2 cups neutral oil ( I use corn) 2 large shallots, thinly sliced 8 cloves of garlic, thinly sliced 1/2 cup Chinese red chili flakes 2 Tbsp gochugaru (Korean red chili flakes) 3/4 tsp salt 1 Tbsp sugar 1 tsp msg (optional) 1 Tbsp soy sauce 1 Tbsp sesame seeds, toasted Pour oil into a medium saucepan, add the shallot and garlic.&nbsp; Turn the heat to medium high and continue to stir until shallot and garlic are slightly browned.&nbsp; You will see the oil bubbling, but this can take up to 15- 20 minutes depending on the oil temperature.&nbsp; While this is cooking, mix both chili flakes, sugar, salt, and msg in a heat proof container.&nbsp; I use stainless steel as the high temperature can cause glass or porcelain to crack.&nbsp; Remove crispy shallots and garlic from oil, set aside. Bring the oil temperature up to 350 degrees.&nbsp; Pour hot oil over chili flake mixture. Stir to combine, then add the soy sauce, toasted sesame seeds, the crispy garlic and shallots.&nbsp; Mix and enjoy.&nbsp; Store this covered in the refrigerator. &nbsp;" />
