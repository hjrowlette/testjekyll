<meta name="description" content="Oh ma goodness. Lemon curd–its everything that is amazing about lemon squares in a perfectly pipeable form.  Lemon curd is thick, and intensely flavored–it can be layered in a cake, put in a pie shell with a meringue topping, added to crepes, mixed with ice cream or mousse, used as filling for thumbprint cookies, or just eaten straight out of the jar. Honestly, the uses for it are only limited by your love of lemons and your imagination! The best part about it in my opinion is the shelf life--because of the high acidity and sugar, it will stay good in the fridge for a month or the freezer for a year, which means you can make a batch and have it ready to go for any time you need a dessert pulled together quickly! Ingredients&nbsp; -zest and juice of 4 lemons (don&#39;t worry about picking out the seeds, you&#39;ll sieve them out later) -1 cup (8 oz) unsalted butter, chopped -1 1/2 cups (12 oz) sugar -4 large eggs Directions 1. Bring lemon juice, lemon zest, and butter to a boil in a stainless steel pan (if you use aluminum your curd will be a little discolored).&nbsp; 2. Whisk eggs and sugar together in a bowl. Temper the eggs with boiling lemon juice mixture by slowly added the hot mixture while constantly whisking. If you add the boiling mixture too quickly you will scramble your eggs and fail miserably at this recipe (I&#39;m mostly joking but it will ruin your curd). 3. Return mixture to pot. Whisk continually while bringing to a boil (you don&#39;t want this stuff to scorch). Continue cooking for five minutes after lemon curd comes to a boil. 4. Pass lemon curd through a fine mesh sieve and cool in the refrigerator or over an ice bath. 5. Wrap in plastic wrap or place in a sturdy container." />
