<meta name="description" content="Quiche! Its breakfast! Its dinner! Its delicious–and it can be customized any which way you want :) This post is more of a guideline that you can take and make your own–but its pretty tasty as is!  Just make sure that whatever meat, veggies, etc you add are cooked before you add them, because your quiche is in the oven for a relatively short period of time. As for the crust, I recommend you use the pate brisee recipe I have posted on here, its great for quiche! The only other note I have is that if you want to make a quiche in larger than an 8-9 inch shell, add 1/2 cup milk or half and half for every egg you add, and increase the cheese and other ingredients accordingly. For the quiche in the picture to the right, I used 5 eggs and an extra cup of milk as well as some broccoli and tomato! Ingredients  8-9 inch brisee crust, fully baked 1/2 cup grated gruyere 1/2 cup chopped onions, sweated and drained 4 oz chopped bacon, sauteed and drained 1 1/2 cups half and half or whole milk 3 eggs salt pepper Directions Sprinkle cheese, onions, and bacon over the bottom of the tart shell (these will rise within the custard as it cooks) Whisk eggs in a bowl. Gradually add milk or half and half. Season well with salt and pepper Strain custard through fine mesh sieve Pour custard into tart shell.  Custard will expand slightly when it bakes, so only fill the shell 3/4 full Bake at 300 to 325 degrees until the quiche feels just firm to the touch and jiggles slightly in the center (for 9 inch dish, it should be around 30-40 minutes). Quiche should be lightly browned when finished.  Serve lukewarm.  Can be baked a few hours in advance and reheated." />
