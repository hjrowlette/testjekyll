<meta name="description" content="And BAM, another pie crust recipe! You thought you could escape pie crusts? YOU FOOL! In all seriousness, this recipe is actually a much better candidate for tarts than pies in my opinion. You could still make it in a pie dish, but fill this bad boy with lemon curd, creme patisserie and fruit, or chocolate mousse for some serious perfection. Unlike brisee, sucree is a tender dough that is not flaky–it is more like a shortbread in its texture. As we talked about in the brisee post, the goal in brisee is to inhibit but not completely prevent gluten development.  Sucree, because of the increase fat as a result of eggs being used, has next to no gluten development which is why the texture is usually quite crumbly. (This also make it a great candidate for an easy Cup4Cup gluten free version! Will hopefully try sometime soon!) Pate sucree can be refrigerated for up to a week or frozen for a month (if frozen, defrost in the fridge overnight prior to use) Ingredients approximately 25oz dough; enough for 2-3 large tarts  8 oz (1 cup) room temperature butter 4 oz (1/2 cup) sugar 1/2 tsp vanilla 1/2 tsp lemon zest (optional) 1 egg (room temperature is preferable) 12 oz (2 3/4 cup) all purpose flour 1/4 tsp salt Directions Cream butter and sugar, scraping sides of the bowl as necessary. Add vanilla and lemon zest (if using). Add egg. Add flour and mix just until combined Work dough on counter until it is well mixed. Divide dough into four portions, and shape into 1/2 inch thick rounds. Wrap in plastic and refrigerate at least one hour (see above for storage instructions). To roll sucree:     a. Lightly flour work surface     b. Smack dough a few times with heavy rolling pin to begin flattening (also allows dough a little time to warm) Begin rolling directly in front of you, turning the dough 90 degrees after each roll to ensure the dough is even thickness and square     c. For a large tart, roll between 1/8 and 1/4 inch thick.       d. Line lightly greased tart pan or pie pan with sucree, being sure to push the dough into the corners of the pan.  Trim excess. Chill for 30 minutes-1 hour prior to baking Line tart pan with parchment paper or aluminum foil and fill with beans, rice, or pie weights. Bake at 375 degrees for 10-15 minutes, then remove the weights and paper and continue to bake for another 5-10 minutes until tart is a light golden brown color." />
