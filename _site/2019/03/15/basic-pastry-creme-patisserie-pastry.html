<meta name="description" content="Hello Happy Bakers! I am FINALLY getting around to posting the recipes from my basic pastry class! I won’t post all of them because there are a few I wasn’t fully impressed with, but most of them were great! I’m going to post them all individually and include any additional notes I have :) First up is pastry cream or creme patisserie–this is a very versatile dessert that is similar to custard, expect it is thicker due to higher starch contents. It can be used as filling in profiteroles or eclairs, fruit tarts, mille feuille, and many other french pastries.  It is typically vanilla but can be flavored as chocolate, coffee, or fruit zest depending on how you plan to use it! If you do want to add other flavors, one way to do so is to steep your milk in the flavoring prior to beginning the recipe Ingredients 16 oz (2 cups) milk 4 egg yolks (do not separate more than 5 minutes ahead of time) (can freeze egg whites for other uses) 4 tbsp cornstarch 4 oz (1/2 cup) sugar vanilla extract or other flavoring to taste Creme patisserie in mille feuille Directions Heat milk to a simmer over medium heat.  While milk is heating, in a separate bowl whisk egg yolks, cornstarch, and sugar together until pale yellow. Gradually add simmering milk to bowl with egg mixture. Return fully combined mixture to pot and cook over medium heat, whisking, while bringing to a boil.  Constantly stir and continue boiling until the flavor of the starch is cooked out, about 5-7 minutes. The pastry cream will become very smooth and shiny, and the sweetness will be much more pronounced. Pass liquid through a fine-mesh sieve into a clean bowl and chill over ice (if you want to use right away). Otherwise let gradually cool at room temp; add vanilla when cream has cooled. fruit tart with pastry cream filling Storage: Pastry cream will keep for a few days in the fridge as long as the surface is covered with plastic wrap (should be in contact with the cream). Cannot be frozen" />

Hello Happy Bakers! I am FINALLY getting around to posting the recipes from my basic pastry class! I won't post all of them because there are a few I wasn't fully impressed with, but most of them were great! I'm going to post them all individually and include any additional notes I have :)<br />
