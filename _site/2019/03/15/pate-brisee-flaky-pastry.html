<meta name="description" content="This is a momentous recipe.  This is the post where I declare my allegiance to gasp a pie crust recipe. Now I have to caveat that literally the next post I am going to do is another pie crust recipe, but when you thing of apple pie or any traditional flaky pie crust, THIS is the recipe I will use unless someone in the future completely blows my mind with a better recipe. Pie crust is scary, and finicky, and it terrifies me more than macarons.  and I did four separate posts on macarons.  I think one of the hardest parts about pie crust is how infrequently people make it–like so many things, the more you do it, the more you struggle and fail, the easier it will get (eventually). At least that is what I’m telling myself! Anyways, Pate Brisee is really the quintessential pastry recipe. It is incredibly versatile and can be used for savory and sweet purposes.  I’ve used this recipe to make turnovers, quiche, and apple pie. The traditional ingredients in pate brisee are flour, fat, salt, and water. That’s it! What makes this recipe tricky isn’t the ingredients themselves, its the process to combine them. If you read my gluten free baking post, I talk pretty extensively about the role that gluten plays in different baked goods, and the information there is really useful for understanding the techniques in this recipe.  I won’t reiterate everything, but here are the key points: gluten development cannot happen without water, but is inhibited by the presence of fat we combine the butter and the flour first because it binds the fat to the flour and helps slow the gluten when we start adding water cold water and butter are used in this recipe because it also helps to slow/prevent the development of gluten the end goal is to have a certain level of gluten development but not to overwork your dough and have too much gluten develop (this is what leads to tough or chewy pie crusts) I’m not sure this recipe is a good candidate to be gluten free (I will probably attempt it at some point regardless), but I’ll shut up and get to the good stuff! Ingredients (makes 14-15oz dough, sufficient for one 9”-10” tart) 8 oz (1 3/4 cup + 2 tbsp) all-purpose flour 4 oz (8 tbsp) cold unsalted butter, cut into 1/2” cubes 1/2 tsp salt 5-6 tbsp ice water (2.5-3 oz) Directions Combine flour, butter, and salt in a bowl. Use a pastry cutter (or set of forks) to cut the butter into the flour until the butter pieces are pea-sized or slightly smaller (the bigger the butter, the flakier. goal is to have pieces no larger than pea sized.  If you cut the butter smaller, your dough will still be tender, but will not be as flaky) Add ice water one tablespoon at a time, mixing the dough using your hand in a claw or rake-like motion to combine.  Use only enough water to hold the dough together, may be a little less or more than listed*.  Fold the dough gently together, DO NOT KNEAD.  (There may be small dry or wet spots, that is fine). Shape dough into a 1/2 thick round disc.  Wrap and chill for at least one hour prior to use (at this point you can store in the fridge up to 2 days, or 3-6 months in the freezer. If you freeze the dough, defrost in the fridge overnight prior to use) To roll the brisee:     a. Lightly flour work surface     b. Smack your dough with a heavy rolling pin a few times to begin flattening (also allows the dough a little time to warm). Begin rolling directly in front of you. Lift and turn the dough 90 degrees after each roll to keep it from sticking to the counter and to help the dough roll evenly. Roll until 1/8 inch thick for tarts or slightly thinner for other uses.     c. Line a lightly greased tart pan or pie pan with the brisee, being sure to push the brisee into the corners.  Trim off excess. Return to refrigerator or freeze for at least 45 minutes prior to baking. Brisee can be partially or fully baked prior to filling.  Line brisee with parchment paper or aluminum foil and fill with rice, beans or pie weights. Bake at 375-400 for about 35 minutes for a 9 inch tart shell, removing weights and paper after the first 20 minutes.  Brisee should be light golden brown and firm to the touch when completely baked. *Amount of water you’ll need is affected by the age of your flour, brand, and the room’s humidity." />

Anyways, Pate Brisee is really the quintessential pastry recipe. It is incredibly versatile and can be used for savory and sweet purposes.&nbsp; I've used this recipe to make turnovers, quiche, and apple pie.<br />

The traditional ingredients in pate brisee are flour, fat, salt, and water. That's it! What makes this recipe tricky isn't the ingredients themselves, its the process to combine them.<br />
<br />
If you read my gluten free baking post, I talk pretty extensively about the role that gluten plays in different baked goods, and the information there is really useful for understanding the techniques in this recipe.&nbsp; I won't reiterate everything, but here are the key points:<br />
<br />
<ul>
<li>gluten development cannot happen without water, but is inhibited by the presence of fat</li>
<li>we combine the butter and the flour first because it binds the fat to the flour and helps slow the gluten when we start adding water</li>
<li>cold water and butter are used in this recipe because it also helps to slow/prevent the development of gluten</li>
<li>the end goal is to have a certain level of gluten development but not to overwork your dough and have too much gluten develop (this is what leads to tough or chewy pie crusts)</li>
</ul>
I'm not sure this recipe is a good candidate to be gluten free (I will probably attempt it at some point regardless), but I'll shut up and get to the good stuff!<br />

(makes 14-15oz dough, sufficient for one 9"-10" tart)<br />
8 oz (1 3/4 cup + 2 tbsp) all-purpose flour<br />
4 oz (8 tbsp) cold unsalted butter, cut into 1/2" cubes<br />
1/2 tsp salt<br />
5-6 tbsp ice water (2.5-3 oz)<br />
<br />
<b>Directions</b><br />
1. Combine flour, butter, and salt in a bowl. Use a pastry cutter (or set of forks) to cut the butter into the flour until the butter pieces are pea-sized or slightly smaller (the bigger the butter, the flakier. goal is to have pieces <u>no larger </u>than pea sized.&nbsp; If you cut the butter smaller, your dough will still be tender, but will not be as flaky)<br />
<br />
2. Add ice water one tablespoon at a time, mixing the dough using your hand in a claw or rake-like motion to combine.&nbsp; Use only enough water to hold the dough together, may be a little less or more than listed*.&nbsp; Fold the dough gently together, DO NOT KNEAD.&nbsp; (There may be small dry or wet spots, that is fine).<br />
<br />
3. Shape dough into a 1/2 thick round disc.&nbsp; Wrap and chill for at least one hour prior to use (at this point you can store in the fridge up to 2 days, or 3-6 months in the freezer. If you freeze the dough, defrost in the fridge overnight prior to use)<br />
<br />
4. To roll the brisee:<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; a. Lightly flour work surface<br />
<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; b. Smack your dough with a heavy rolling pin a few times to begin flattening (also allows the dough a little time to warm). Begin rolling directly in front of you. Lift and turn the dough 90 degrees after each roll to keep it from sticking to the counter and to help the dough roll evenly. Roll until 1/8 inch thick for tarts or slightly thinner for other uses.<br />
<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; c. Line a lightly greased tart pan or pie pan with the brisee, being sure to push the brisee into the corners.&nbsp; Trim off excess.<br />
<br />
5. Return to refrigerator or freeze for at least 45 minutes prior to baking.<br />
<br />
6. Brisee can be partially or fully baked prior to filling.&nbsp; Line brisee with parchment paper or aluminum foil and fill with rice, beans or pie weights. Bake at 375-400 for about 35 minutes for a 9 inch tart shell, removing weights and paper after the first 20 minutes.&nbsp; Brisee should be light golden brown and firm to the touch when completely baked.<br />
<br />
*Amount of water you'll need is affected by the age of your flour, brand, and the room's humidity.
