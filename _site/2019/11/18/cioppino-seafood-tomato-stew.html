<meta name="description" content="Cioppino is something that I tried for the first time when I was still working at Carrabba’s. It was good, but isn’t homemade always better? This is definitely time, though not overtly labor, intensive. It was warm and hearty, perfect for a chilly night in when you want to spend the evening in the kitchen with bunches of delicious seafood. &lt;div&gt; For once I actually followed this recipe to a T, that being said, I’m writing this post with the changes that I would make for next time, to make life a little easier. The biggest changes I made are that I wouldn’t use fish stock again, I made it ahead of time and it really wasn’t worth it. I could barely tell it was in the red sauce. I didn’t include clams or squid in my recipe, so I used extra shrimp and mussels. These are small things that make the whole recipe easier, and this original recipe is in the bottom of the post if you want to compare! I would highly recommend all super fresh seafood for this. Don’t buy frozen shrimp or scallops, that being said, I’m sure in a pinch it would do the trick, just be sure to defrost ahead of time and pat very dry before searing. I ate this with a GF baguette, but any loaf of crusty bread would be divine. &lt;/div&gt; Ingredients: 4 T. unsalted butter, divided 1 C. EVOO, divided 2 large carrots, peeled, trimmed, minced 1 leek, white part only, trimmed, minced 1 large yellow onion, minced 1 red bell pepper, minced 1 green bell pepper, minced 2 celery stalks, minched 4 cloves garlic, finely chopped 3 cloves garlic, smashed salt and pepper to taste 6 oz tomato paste 1 T. dried basil 1 T. dried oregano 1 T. dried thyme 1 t. cayenne 2 c. dry white wine, divided 4 c. chicken stock or water 30 oz. crushed Italian tomato 3 bay leaves 1/2 lb. sea scallops 1/2 - 1 lb shrimp, peeled, deveined 1/2 lb hearty white fish (mahi, halibut, grouper) 1 lb mussels Directions: In a large dutch oven over medium heat, melt 2 tablespoons of butter and 2 tablespoons of olive oil. Add the carrot, leek, onion, red and green bell peppers, celery and garlic. Season with salt and pepper. Stir and cook until the vegetables are softened, about 15 minutes. Scoop half of the veggies out and set aside. Stir in the tomato paste, basil, oregano, thyme and cayenne into remaining veggies and cook until the tomato paste starts to brown, about 10-15 minutes. Let the paste develop good dark spots before continuing. It really deepens the flavor. Add half the white wine to deglaze, stirring to loosen and bits stuck to the bottom of the pot. Add the stock, crushed tomatoes, and bay leaves. Stir together, bring to a boil and then reduce to low, cover and simmer for 30 minutes. Once the sauce has finished cooking remove the bay leaves and use an immersion blender to make the sauce completely smooth. Then add back in the veggies that were set aside earlier. Make sure to taste and adjust salt and pepper at this point. Turn off and set aside while you cook the seafood. In a large skillet add 2 tablespoons of salt and pepper, season all of the seafood with salt and pepper after patting dry with paper towels. Add scallops to the pan and sear the first side to golden brown, about 3 minutes, flip and sear the other side, 2 minutes more and then remove. Place on a plate and set in a warm oven to keep hot until everything else is ready. In same skillet add more oil and cook all the shrimp for 3 minutes, flip and finish another 2 minutes on the second side. Place on same plate as scallops in oven. Add more oil to the pan and add fish pieces and crushed garlic cloves and remaining 2 tablespoons of butter. Cook 2-3 minutes until turning opaque halfway though, flip and baste with butter garlic mixture. Remove from pan and place in oven. Add clean mussels to the same pan and add remaining cup of white wine, cover the pan and steam for 5 minutes until the shellfish pop open. Remove from heat. Place mussels in a bowl, throwing away any that have not opened. Dump all of the liquid from the pan into the red sauce, being sure to scrap all of the crusty bits from the bottom. Serve individual bowls with seafood, adding red sauce on top of everything. Serve with bread. This recipe is a lot easier than it seems. What really takes the longest is chopping all of the veggies very fine. I would absolutely make this for a crowd! You could make the red sauce the day before, and then once the seafood is seared, it reheats really easy once its covered in red sauce. Add a glass of white wine and this is an amazing seafood combination! Once that I can’t wait to make again! Until next time, Happy Eating! https://tasty.co/recipe/cioppino" />

1 large yellow onion, minced<br />
1 red bell pepper, minced<br />
1 green bell pepper, minced<br />
2 celery stalks, minched<br />
4 cloves garlic, finely chopped<br />
3 cloves garlic, smashed<br />
salt and pepper to taste<br />
6 oz tomato paste<br />
1 T. dried basil<br />
1 T. dried oregano<br />
1 T. dried thyme<br />
1 t. cayenne<br />
2 c. dry white wine, divided<br />
4 c. chicken stock or water<br />
30 oz. crushed Italian tomato<br />
3 bay leaves<br />
1/2 lb. sea scallops<br />
1/2 - 1 lb shrimp, peeled, deveined<br />
1/2 lb hearty white fish (mahi, halibut, grouper)<br />
1 lb mussels<br />
<br />
Directions:<br />
- In a large dutch oven over medium heat, melt 2 tablespoons of butter and 2 tablespoons of olive oil. Add the carrot, leek, onion, red and green bell peppers, celery and garlic. Season with salt and pepper. Stir and cook until the vegetables are softened, about 15 minutes.<br />
<br />
- Scoop half of the veggies out and set aside. Stir in the tomato paste, basil, oregano, thyme and cayenne into remaining veggies and cook until the tomato paste starts to brown, about 10-15 minutes. Let the paste develop good dark spots before continuing. It really deepens the flavor.<br />
<br />
- Add half the white wine to deglaze, stirring to loosen and bits stuck to the bottom of the pot.<br />
<br />
- Add the stock, crushed tomatoes, and bay leaves. Stir together, bring to a boil and then reduce to low, cover and simmer for 30 minutes. Once the sauce has finished cooking remove the bay leaves and use an immersion blender to make the sauce completely smooth. Then add back in the veggies that were set aside earlier. Make sure to taste and adjust salt and pepper at this point. Turn off and set aside while you cook the seafood.<br />
<br />
- In a large skillet add 2 tablespoons of salt and pepper, season all of the seafood with salt and pepper after patting dry with paper towels. Add scallops to the pan and sear the first side to golden brown, about 3 minutes, flip and sear the other side, 2 minutes more and then remove. Place on a plate and set in a warm oven to keep hot until everything else is ready.<br />
<br />
- In same skillet add more oil and cook all the shrimp for 3 minutes, flip and finish another 2 minutes on the second side. Place on same plate as scallops in oven. Add more oil to the pan and add fish pieces and crushed garlic cloves and remaining 2 tablespoons of butter. Cook 2-3 minutes until turning opaque halfway though, flip and baste with butter garlic mixture. Remove from pan and place in oven.<br />
<br />
- Add clean mussels to the same pan and add remaining cup of white wine, cover the pan and steam for 5 minutes until the shellfish pop open. Remove from heat. Place mussels in a bowl, throwing away any that have not opened. Dump all of the liquid from the pan into the red sauce, being sure to scrap all of the crusty bits from the bottom.<br />
<br />
- Serve individual bowls with seafood, adding red sauce on top of everything. Serve with bread.<br />
<br />
This recipe is a lot easier than it seems. What really takes the longest is chopping all of the veggies very fine. I would absolutely make this for a crowd! You could make the red sauce the day before, and then once the seafood is seared, it reheats really easy once its covered in red sauce. Add a glass of white wine and this is an amazing seafood combination! Once that I can't wait to make again!<br />
