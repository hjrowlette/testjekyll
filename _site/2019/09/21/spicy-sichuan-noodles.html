<meta name="description" content="This recipe is a Mom-find (that I got suckered into posting!) that pairs AMAZINGLY WELL with the stir fried sichuan green bean recipe. Hold on, I know, why would I put two  different sichaun recipes the same night? They would taste the same! WELL HOLD YOUR HORSES BECAUSE YOU ARE VERY WRONG. These two recipes are perfectly complimentary but very different at the same time. The noodles are nutty and umami, whereas the green beans are spicy and crisp. They are the perfect duo :) I know this recipe says Spicy, but honestly it didn’t have too much heat. Definitely recommend if you want more spice to increase the white pepper and the red pepper flakes! Ingredients: 8 ounces ground pork 3 tbsp soy sauce 2 tbsp Chinese rice cooking wine or dry sherry ground white pepper 2 tbsp oyster sauce 1/4 cup peanut butter or asian sesame paste 1 tbsp rice vinegar 1 1/4 cups chicken broth 1 tbsp vegetable oil 6 cloves garlic, minced 1 tbsp grated fresh ginger 3/4 tsp red pepper flakes 1 tbsp toasted sesame oil 12 oz dried asian noodles (width close to linguine or fettuccine) 3 medium scallions, sliced thin 1 tbsp sichuan peppercorns, toasted and ground Directions: Combine pork, 1 tbsp soy sauce, wine, and pinch white pepper in small bowl. Stir well and set aside. Whisk together oyster sauce, remaining 2 tbsp soy sauce, peanut butter, vinegar, and pinch white pepper in medium bowl. Whisk in chicken broth and set aside. Bring pot of water to boil. Meanwhile, heat skillet over high heat, add vegetable oil and swirl to coat.  Add pork and cook, breaking meat into small pieces, until well browned. Stir in garlic, ginger, and pepper flakes and cook until fragrant, about 1 minute. Add peanut butter mixture and bring to a boil, whisking to combine, then reduce heat to medium-low and simmer to blend flavors, stirring occasionally, about 3 minutes.  Stir in sesame oil. While sauce simmers, add noodles to boiling water and cook until tender. 6.Drain noodles and divide among bowls. Ladle sauce over noodles, sprinkle with scallions and ground sichuan peppercorns." />
