<meta name="description" content="Mom made this recipe last week and paired it with sichuan pork noodles, and let me tell you–home. run. Hold on, I know, why would I put two  different sichaun recipes the same night? They would taste the same! WELL HOLD YOUR HORSES BECAUSE YOU ARE VERY WRONG This recipe has great flavor, comes together really quickly, and would go great with the sechuan noodles, over some white rice, or all by themself! Ingredients: 2 tbsp soy sauce 2 tbsp water 1 tbsp dry sherry 1 tsp sugar 1/2 tsp cornstarch 1/4 tsp ground white pepper 1/4 tsp red pepper flakes 1/4 tsp dry ground mustard 2 tbsp vegetable oil 1 lb green beans, trimmed and cut into pieces 1/4 lb ground pork 3 garlic cloves, minced 1 tbsp grated fresh ginger 3 scallions, white and light green parts only, sliced thin 1 tsp toasted sesame oil Directions: Stir together soy sauce, water, sherry, sugar, cornstarch, white pepper, pepper flakes, and dry mustard in small bowl until sugar dissolves. Heat oil in a nonstick skillet over high heat until just smoking.  Add beans and cook, stirring frequently, until crisp-tender and skins are shriveled and blackened in spots, 5-8 minutes.  Transfer beans to a large plate. Reduce heat to medium high and add pork to skillet. Cook, breaking pork into small pieces, until no pink remains, about 2 minutes. Add garlic and ginger and cook 15-20 seconds. Stir sauce to recombine and return beans to skillet with sauce. Toss and cook until sauce is thickened, 5-10 seconds. Remove from heat and stir in scallions and sesame oil. Serve immediately." />
