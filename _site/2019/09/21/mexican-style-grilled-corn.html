<meta name="description" content="Hey All!  What is this place?! It’s been so long, I’m glad I remember how to post XD Well the good news is I’m coming back in serious style with a recipe thats going to blow. your. mind. Mexican corn. I know the title says grilled, but honestly you could easily cook your corn on the stove in a cast iron or roast it in the oven to get that same charred effect with devastatingly delicious results! This recipe is fast, easy, and goes great if you are grilling meat or burgers and need a side with some serious flavor! Ingredients: 1 1/2 ounces grated Pecorino Romano cheese (3/4 cup) (could also use cotija!) 1/4 cup mayo 3 tbsp sour cream 3 tbsp minced fresh cilantro 4 tsp lime juice 1 garlic clove, minced 3/4 tsp chili powder 1/4 tsp pepper 1/4 tsp cayenne pepper 4 tsp vegetable oil 1/4 tsp salt 6 ears of corn, husks and silk removed Directions: 1.  Prepare charcoal or gas grill as you normally would for direct heating (high heat on gas grill). Combine pecorino, mayo, sour cream, cilantro, lime juice, garlic, 1/4 tsp chili powder, pepper, and cayenne in a large bowl and set aside. In a small dish, combine the oil, salt, and remaining 1/2 tsp of chili powder. Brush this mixture onto the corn. Place corn on grill and cook until lightly charred on all sides, 7-12 minutes, turning as needed. Once the corn is cooked remove from grilled and rub cheese mixture all over the cobs to coat." />
