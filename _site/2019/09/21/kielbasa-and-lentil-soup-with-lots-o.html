<meta name="description" content="Hi there! This is a great soup recipe from Bon Appetit! It’s really similar to the family favorite lentil soup recipe we make, but its got great heat balanced by a dollop of yogurt. Super fast and easy, and great for lunch all week :) &lt;div&gt;Kielbasa and Lentil Soup with Basil Ingredients: 2 medium onions 2 celery stalks 1 fennel bulb 6 garlic cloves 12 oz. kielbasa (or smoked sausage) 1/4 EVOO 1/2 tsp red pepper flakes kosher salt 2 tbsp tomato paste 1 1/4 cup lentils 2 cups basil leaves 1/2 cup whole milk greek yogurt Directions: Peel and finely chop onions. Chop celery into 1/2” pieces. Cut off stems and dark green parts of fennel, discard or save for another use (great for homemade broths). Cut fennel bulb in half, then finely chop. Smash garlic to relatively small pieces (or mince if you want). Place all these ingredients in a large bowl and set aside. Slice kielbasa crosswise into 1/4”-thick coins. Heat large heavy pot over medium heat. Add EVOO and swirl to coat. Cook kielbasa in a single layer, undisturbed, until golden brown underneath, about 3 minutes.  Turn pieces and cook, stirring occasionally, until mostly browned on both side, 1-2 minutes longer. Reduce heat to low. Add onion mixture, red pepper flakes, and 1 tsp salt and cook, stirring often, until vegetables are softened and onion is translucent, 8-10 minutes. Add 2 tbsp tomato paste and cook, stirring often, until it darkens in color, 1-2 minutes. Add lentils, 1 tsp salt, and 4 1/2 cups water and stir to combine.  Increase heat to medium-high and bring to a simmer. Once simmering, reduce heat to medium-low, cover pot, and cook (keeping soup at a bare simmer) until lentils are tender, about 20-45 minutes. Remove from heat, and add 2 cups of basil, stirring to wilt. Serve, topping with a dollop of greek yogurt, a drizzle of olive oil, and tender celery leaves if you have them. https://www.bonappetit.com/recipe/kielbasa-and-lentil-soup-with-lots-of-basil&lt;/div&gt;" />
