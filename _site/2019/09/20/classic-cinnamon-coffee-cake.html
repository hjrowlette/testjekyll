<meta name="description" content="All hail coffee cake! And not just any ol’ coffee cake, gluten free coffee cake! It’s reminiscent of cowboy coffee cake, all you need is some fresh fruit and of course, a cup of coffee. The original recipe designs a gluten free cake that is also paleo friendly and dairy free. Meaning it doesn’t have any sugar or oil in addition to milk. Well I can’t live without sugar! So I took it upon my self to try substitutes and the resulting cake was just slightly sweet. Perfect for breakfast without feeling like dessert. I didn’t notice that the crumble stood out a lot to me, so I want to find a way to make it extra crumbly. I also didn’t include the icing, because it calls for homemade icing sugar from maple sugar (umm, no). So I’ll just sub it for regular icing sugar. Crumb Topping: 3/4 c. blanched almond flour 1/3 c. brown sugar or maple syrup ( I did a combo of both to equal the final volume) 1 1/2 tsp cinnamon 1/4 c. butter, cold, cut into pieces Cake: 3 eggs, room temp 1/4 full fat milk 1 Tbsp lemon juice 3 Tbsp vegetable oil 1/3 c. sugar 1/3 c. brown sugar 1 tsp vanilla 2 c. almond flour 1/4 c. arrowroot flour ( I use tapioca starch, it’s a perfect substitution) 1/2 tsp baking soda 1/4 tsp. sea salt 2 tsp cinnamon Icing: 1/3 c icing sugar 2 tbsp. arrowroot flour (see above) 1/2 tsp cinnamon 3-4 tsp full fat milk (a tablespoon of maple syrup would be delicious!) Directions: Preheat oven to 350, and line an 8x8” square cake pan with parchment paper along the bottom and sides. Prepare the crumble topping first. Place all ingredients in a bowl and combine using a fork or pastry blender until a coarse crumbly mixture forms. Place in fridge until ready to use. For the cake: In a medium bowl combine the almond flour, arrowroot (or tapioca), baking soda, salt and cinnamon, set aside. In a separate large bowl, whisk together the eggs, milk, lemon juice, sugar(s), oil and vanilla until very smooth. Stir the dry ingredients into the wet until well combined. Transfer batter to prepped pan, the batter with be somewhat thick. Spread evenly and top with crumble. Bake in preheated oven for 28-30 minutes until toothpick comes out clean. Allow to cool, drizzle with icing if desired and enjoy! Best served warm. Original Recipe: https://www.paleorunningmomma.com/cinnamon-coffee-cake-paleo/ . Until next time, happy eating!" />

I also didn't include the icing, because it calls for homemade icing sugar from maple sugar (umm, no). So I'll just sub it for regular icing sugar. <br />
