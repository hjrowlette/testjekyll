<meta name="description" content="I’m low key obsessed with lentils. I don’t know what it is about them, but hands down it is one of those foods that tastes better after its been cooked and sits in the fridge for a day or so! We have three great lentil soups in our family repertoire (classic one on recipe cards, moroccan lentil soup, and lentil basil soup). It’s time for lentils to shine in a whole new fashion though. Cold lentil salad. It’s absolutely delish and is a great recipe to make on a Monday and portion out for lunches for the rest of the week! I will admit I left off the olives because they aren’t my favorite, but I still thought it was great :) Lentil Salad Ingredients 1 large bunch Tuscan kale (about 10 oz.) Kosher salt ½ cup raw almonds 3 scallions 4 garlic cloves 1 lemon ½ cup extra-virgin olive oil 1½ cups black beluga or French green lentils 1 Tbsp. cumin seeds ½ tsp. crushed red pepper flakes 5 oz. feta 1 cup Castelvetrano olives Directions 1. Strip leaves off stems from&nbsp;1 large bunch Tuscan kale; discard stems or save for later! Stack leaves, then roll into fat cigars. Slice crosswise into ¼&quot; strips to long, thin ribbons. Unfurl ribbons and run your knife through them just once or twice more to shorten any very long strips. Transfer to a large bowl, season with salt, and massage until kale is silkier, softer, and darker in color, 1–2 minutes. 2. Bring a large pot of heavily salted water to a boil over high heat. Add&nbsp;1½ cups black beluga or French green lentils&nbsp;to now-boiling water, reduce heat to medium, and simmer, uncovered, until lentils are tender but still al dente, 20–25 minutes (they&#39;ll turn mushy if overcooked). You&#39;re cooking the lentil like pasta so that you can monitor their doneness as they cook and make sure they don&#39;t get too soft. 3. While you&#39;re working on the lentils, prep the spiced oil. Coarsely chop&nbsp;½ cup raw almonds; set aside. Trim&nbsp;3 scallions&nbsp;and separate white and green parts (save the green parts for later in the recipe); thinly slice white parts and transfer to a small skillet. Smash and peel&nbsp;4 garlic cloves. Add those to same skillet, too. Using a vegetable peeler or paring knife, remove&nbsp;three 3&quot; strips of lemon peel&nbsp;(avoiding white pith); reserve rest of the lemon for your salad dressing. Add peels to skillet. Pour&nbsp;½ cup extra-virgin olive oil&nbsp;into skillet and stir so that all of the elements are coated in oil. While lentils cook, heat skillet with scallion mixture over medium. Cook, stirring occasionally, until garlic starts to brown and lemon peel starts to curl, about 3 minutes. Add almonds and cook, stirring frequently, until almonds are browned, about 3 more minutes. &lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;5. Remove from heat and stir in 1 Tbsp. cumin seeds and ½ tsp. crushed red pepper flakes—the residual heat from the oil will bloom those spices and bring out their flavors.&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt; 6. Strain mixture through a fine-mesh sieve into a small bowl, shaking to help oil drain; reserve oil (that&#39;s the base of your salad dressing). Spread almond mixture on a paper towel-lined plate or baking sheet. Season with salt and let cool (the nuts will get crunchier as they sit). 7. Crumble&nbsp;5 oz. feta&nbsp;into bowl with kale. Smash&nbsp;1 cup Castelvetrano olives&nbsp;with the back of your knife; remove pits. Tear olives into large pieces and add to bowl. Thinly slice reserved scallion greens and add most to bowl (save some for serving). Add&nbsp;juice of reserved lemon&nbsp;and&nbsp;½ tsp. salt. 8. Drain lentils well, shaking to get rid of excess moisture, and add to bowl with kale; season with salt. Add infused oil and half of nuts and toss to combine. 9. Divide salad among bowls. Garnish with remaining nuts and scallion greens. (If you’re taking this to work, just throw all of the scallions and nuts in at once—or bring them to work in separate containers and be that person garnishing your desk salad. You&#39;re worth it.) https://www.bonappetit.com/recipe/make-ahead-lentil-salad&lt;/div&gt;" />

<div class="MsoNormal">
1. Strip leaves off stems from&nbsp;1 large bunch Tuscan
kale; discard stems or save for later! Stack leaves, then roll into fat cigars. Slice crosswise into
¼" strips to long, thin ribbons. Unfurl ribbons and run your knife through
them just once or twice more to shorten any very long strips. Transfer to a
large bowl, season with salt, and massage until kale is silkier, softer, and
darker in color, 1–2 minutes.<o:p></o:p></div>
<div class="MsoNormal">
<br /></div>
<div class="MsoNormal">
2. Bring a large pot of heavily salted water to a boil over
high heat. Add&nbsp;1½ cups black beluga or French green lentils&nbsp;to now-boiling water, reduce heat to medium, and simmer, uncovered, until lentils are tender but still al dente, 20–25 minutes (they'll turn mushy if overcooked).

While you're working on the lentils, prep the spiced oil. Coarsely chop&nbsp;½
cup raw almonds; set aside. Trim&nbsp;3 scallions&nbsp;and separate
white and green parts (save the green parts for later in the recipe); thinly
slice white parts and transfer to a small skillet. Smash and peel&nbsp;4
garlic cloves. Add those to same skillet, too. Using a vegetable peeler or
paring knife, remove&nbsp;three 3" strips of lemon peel&nbsp;(avoiding
white pith); reserve rest of the lemon for your salad dressing. Add peels to
skillet. Pour&nbsp;½ cup extra-virgin olive oil&nbsp;into skillet and
stir so that all of the elements are coated in oil.<o:p></o:p></div>
<div class="MsoNormal">

4. While lentils cook, heat skillet with scallion mixture over
medium. Cook, stirring occasionally, until garlic starts to brown and lemon
peel starts to curl, about 3 minutes. Add almonds and cook, stirring
frequently, until almonds are browned, about 3 more minutes.&nbsp;<div><br /></div><div>5. Remove from heat

Smash&nbsp;1 cup Castelvetrano olives&nbsp;with the back of your knife;
remove pits. Tear olives into large pieces and add to bowl. Thinly slice
reserved scallion greens and add most to bowl (save some for serving).
