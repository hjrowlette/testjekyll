<meta name="description" content="It’s been a long journey from where this blog started, I think we can all agree on that. And if you remember, the inaugural recipe for this blog was none other than chocolate cake. But there has been a hole on this blog for too long, because chocolate needs vanilla like cheese needs crackers, and finally, we are here. Vanilla. Cake. This recipe is awesome. It’s light, crumby, and melts in your mouth. It doesn’t have the same ridiculous moistness from our chocolate cake recipe, but man is this a tender cake. It’s also very stable, so if you feel like doing some crazy decorations it’ll do a good job of holding up under the weight. And the best part? Works great with a cup for cup gluten free substitute flour :) A couple of things–this recipe calls for cake flour. I can confirm it is worth it–however, if you don’t feel like keeping a box of cake flour just for this recipe, all purpose does work fine. Buttermilk is a must, even if its a homemade substitute. And the double bonus? When making your buttercream for this cake, you can use more of that buttermilk instead of regular milk or cream. It makes the frosting a little bit tangy and helps cut through the sweetness in a super subtle way. Perfect Vanilla Cake Ingredients 1 cup salted butter, room temperature 2 cups granulated sugar 1/4 cup vegetable oil 4 eggs 1 tablespoon vanilla extract 2 teaspoons baking powder 1 teaspoon kosher salt 3 cups cake flour (or CFC gluten free substitute. regular all-purpose works too) 1 cup buttermilk Directions 1. Preheat oven to 350°F. Coat 2, 8 or 9- inch round cake pans with nonstick spray, line the bottoms with parchment paper, and flour the sides. Set aside. 2. In the bowl of your stand mixer, fitted with paddle attachment mix the butter and sugar together for 2 minutes. Add in the oil, eggs, vanilla, baking powder, and salt, and continue mixing for an additional minute until smooth and combined, scraping the sides of the bowl as necessary to make sure everything is evenly mixed. 3. Turn the mixer to low speed and in alternating portions add in the buttermilk and flour, beginning and ending with flour. Mix for 30 seconds, until combined and smooth, again, scraping the sides of the bowl as needed. 4. Pour half of the cake batter into each prepared pan. 5. Bake for 30 – 35 minutes, or until the center of the cakes are set, and a toothpick inserted in the middle comes out clean. 6. Allow the cakes to cool in the pans for 10 minutes, and then remove the cakes and allow to cool completely on a wire rack. https://cookiesandcups.com/perfect-vanilla-cake/" />
