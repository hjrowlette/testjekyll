<meta name="description" content="Yeah. You read that right. DONUTS. Not just any donuts, homemade gluten free donuts. I’ll admit I was skeptical. And terrified. Boiling oil and I don’t get along at the best of times. But all said and done; we had our highs and we had our lows, but at the end of the day, I had the best fried food since gluten and I said farewell. This recipe came originated here: https://glutenfreeonashoestring.com/glazed-yeast-raised-doughnuts/ And I followed the recipe as instructed: Ingredients: 2 1/2 cups (350 g)) all-purpose gluten free flour (I used bob’s red mill 1 to 1) 1 1/2 teaspoons xanthan gum (omit if blend already contains it) 1/2 teaspoon kosher salt 1/4 teaspoon cream of tartar 1/4 teaspoon baking soda 1/4 cup (50 g) granulated sugar 2 1/2 teaspoons (8g) instant yeast 1/2 teaspoon nutmeg (optional) 1 teaspoon apple cider vinegar 1 egg (50 g out of shell), plus 1 egg white (25 g) 1 cup and 2 tablespoons (9 fluid ounces) milk (any kind, just not non fat), at room temperature 4 tablespoons (56 g) unsalted butter, melted and cooled Directions: In a large bowl place flour, xanthan gum, salt, cream or tartar, baking soda and sugar. Whisk well to combine. Add yeast and nutmeg (if using), whisk again. Add the vinegar, egg, egg white, milk and melted butter, and mix to combine. Mix on low speed until the liquid is absorbed by the dry ingredients, then turn speed to high and mix for about 2 minutes or until very well combined. The dough will be wet but should scrape easily of the sides of the mixer with a spatula. Spray the inside of a lidded bucket or bowl with cooking oil spray and scrape donut dough into the container, and cover. Place in the fridge to rise and chill for about an hour or up to 2 days. You can work with the dough immediately, but it will be stickier and harder to handle. When ready to work with the dough, turn onto a lightly floured surface. Line rimmed baking sheets with parchment paper and set them aside. Sprinkle the dough lightly with extra flour and turn over on itself a few times to create a smoother dough. Press into a disk, and roll to about 1/2 inch thick. Flour a donut/biscuit cutter and cut into donut shapes. Place on prepared baking sheets and reroll scraps and continue to shape donuts until all the dough is used.  Cover baking sheets with oiled plastic wrap and place in warm draft free spot and allow to rise to 150% of original size. Deep-frying instructions: In large, heavy bottomed stock pot, heat at least 2 inches of oil to about 350 degrees F. Fry a few old chunks of bread to dirty the oil (this well help the donuts fry better). Fry donuts in small batches, about 1 minutes (or less) a side until golden. Drain on wire rack lined with paper towels. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Okay, I kind of followed the recipe. I mean I tried! After letting my dough rise for two days in the fridge I was ready to make my donuts and let rise a second time. The problem? I couldn’t shape the dough. It was a wet soggy mess and I knew that if I kept adding flour it would result in tough inedible donuts. So I quit. I went and sulked and acknowledge that this wasn’t happening and prepared myself to throw the dough away. BUT I PERSERVED! Just kidding, the truth was I figured at this point I’ve got nothing to lose lets try baking half of it and frying the other half in dollops just to see what it looks like. So I heated a scant 1 1/2 inches of oil in a medium sauce pan and dolloped out tablespoon-fulls and let them fry. And I’ll be darned if they weren’t beautiful! They definitely took longer than a minute a side and I was using about 5 utensils at this point because the dough was so sticky that I didn’t want my dough spoons to get into the oil. So 3 spoons, 1 fork, and a large slotted spoon later I pulled out my first batch. They were good! Not great, but good. The dough was barely sweet, I missed where in the original recipe it said that they were mildly sweet. I wish I had noticed and added more sugar. And to be honest, the yeast taste was a little overwhelming. But the fried texture was so perfect and the texture of the inside was lighter than I dared hope. Besides, once you slather some icing on these puppies how can they not taste good? I ended up frying probably 1/2 of the dough. I had to make sure to keep them small, one batch was still raw in the middle. We ate them as soon as they were cool enough to handle and I was glad I didn’t just pitch it. Overall, a learning experience. I will make these again, if I had gone into this knowing I didn’t have the shape the dough, it wouldn’t have seemed like so much work. Truthfully, they weren’t that hard. This would be a great base for hushpuppies. And the other half of the dough? Knowing it wasn’t sweet, I decided to stick with baking it. I rolled out 6 little ‘buns’ and baked for 15 minutes at 350. Took them out, brushed with butter and kosher salt and baked an additional 10. And how did they taste? Funny story I haven’t tried one yet, so we will find out! And thus concludes my first experience (and almost disaster) with frying donuts (gluten free too) and we will see what bribery I required to give it a second shot and trying to improve. Until next time, happy eating!" />

    Yeah. You read that right. DONUTS. Not just any donuts, homemade gluten free donuts. I'll admit I was skeptical. And terrified. Boiling oil and I don't get along at the best of times. But all said and done; we had our highs and we had our lows, but at the end of the day, I had the best fried food since gluten and I said farewell. <br />
<br />
<a name='more'></a>This recipe came originated here:<br />
<a href="https://glutenfreeonashoestring.com/glazed-yeast-raised-doughnuts/">https://glutenfreeonashoestring.com/glazed-yeast-raised-doughnuts/</a><br />
<br />
And I followed the recipe as instructed:<br />
<br />
Ingredients:<br />
<br />
2 1/2 cups (350 g)) all-purpose gluten free flour (I used bob's red mill 1 to 1)<br />
1 1/2 teaspoons xanthan gum (omit if blend already contains it)<br />
1/2 teaspoon kosher salt<br />
1/4 teaspoon cream of tartar<br />
1/4 teaspoon baking soda<br />
1/4 cup (50 g) granulated sugar<br />
2 1/2 teaspoons (8g) instant yeast<br />
1/2 teaspoon nutmeg (optional)<br />
1 teaspoon apple cider vinegar<br />
1 egg (50 g out of shell), plus 1 egg white (25 g)<br />
1 cup and 2 tablespoons (9 fluid ounces) milk (any kind, just not non fat), at room temperature<br />
4 tablespoons (56 g) unsalted butter, melted and cooled <br />
<br />
Directions: <br />
<br />
In a large bowl place flour, xanthan gum, salt, cream or tartar, baking soda and sugar. Whisk well to combine. Add yeast and nutmeg (if using), whisk again. Add the vinegar, egg, egg white, milk and melted butter, and mix to combine. Mix on low speed until the liquid is absorbed by the dry ingredients, then turn speed to high and mix for about 2 minutes or until very well combined. The dough will be wet but should scrape easily of the sides of the mixer with a spatula.<br />

Spray the inside of a lidded bucket or bowl with cooking oil spray and scrape donut dough into the container, and cover. Place in the fridge to rise and chill for about an hour or up to 2 days. You can work with the dough immediately, but it will be stickier and harder to handle. <br />
<br />
When ready to work with the dough, turn onto a lightly floured surface. Line rimmed baking sheets with parchment paper and set them aside. Sprinkle the dough lightly with extra flour and turn over on itself a few times to create a smoother dough. Press into a disk, and roll to about 1/2 inch thick. Flour a donut/biscuit cutter and cut into donut shapes. Place on prepared baking sheets and reroll scraps and continue to shape donuts until all the dough is used.&nbsp; Cover baking sheets with oiled plastic wrap and place in warm draft free spot and allow to rise to 150% of original size.<br />
<br />
Deep-frying instructions:<br />
In large, heavy bottomed stock pot, heat at least 2 inches of oil to about 350 degrees F. Fry a few old chunks of bread to dirty the oil (this well help the donuts fry better). Fry donuts in small batches, about 1 minutes (or less) a side until golden. Drain on wire rack lined with paper towels. <br />
<u>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </u><br />

Okay, I kind of followed the recipe. I mean I tried! After letting my dough rise for two days in the fridge I was ready to make my donuts and let rise a second time. The problem? I couldn't shape the dough. It was a wet soggy mess and I knew that if I kept adding flour it would result in tough inedible donuts. So I quit. I went and sulked and acknowledge that this wasn't happening and prepared myself to throw the dough away.<br />

Just kidding, the truth was&nbsp;I figured at this point I've got nothing to lose lets try baking half of it and frying the other half in dollops just to see what it looks like. So I heated a scant 1 1/2 inches of oil in a medium sauce pan and dolloped out tablespoon-fulls and let them fry. And I'll be darned if they weren't beautiful! They definitely took longer than a minute a side and I&nbsp;was using about 5 utensils at this point because the dough was so sticky that I didn't want my dough spoons to get into the oil. So 3 spoons, 1 fork, and a large slotted spoon later I pulled out my first batch.<br />
<br />
They were good! Not great, but good. The dough was barely sweet, I missed where in the original recipe it said that they were mildly sweet. I wish I had noticed and added more sugar. And to be honest, the yeast taste was a little overwhelming. But the fried texture was so perfect and the texture of the inside was lighter than I dared hope. Besides, once you slather some icing on these puppies how can they not taste good? I ended up frying probably 1/2 of the dough. I had to make sure to keep them small, one batch was still raw in the middle. We ate them as soon as they were cool enough to handle and I was glad I didn't just pitch it.<br />

I will make these again, if I had gone into this knowing I didn't have the shape the dough, it wouldn't have seemed like so much work. Truthfully, they weren't that hard. This would be a great base for hushpuppies. <br />
<br />
And the other half of the dough? Knowing it wasn't sweet, I decided to stick with baking it. I rolled out 6 little 'buns' and baked for 15 minutes at 350. Took them out, brushed with butter and kosher salt and baked an additional 10. And how did they taste? Funny story I haven't tried one yet, so we will find out!<br />
<br />
And thus concludes my first experience (and almost disaster) with frying donuts (gluten free too) and we will see what bribery I required to give it a second shot and trying to improve.<br />
<br />
Until next time, happy eating! <br />
