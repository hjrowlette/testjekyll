<meta name="description" content="As I have stated before (see rigatoni with vodka sauce post) I am not really a pasta person–it’s not high on my list of things to cook because I usually end up feeling guilt about eating that many carbs in one meal.  However, after chatting with Brit today about a recipe that has popped up on Bon Appetit’s page, “we” (read “I”) got into a spirited discussion about a particular pasta dish–carbonara. Now my mother can testify that I like carbonara–we ate it in Rome and it was absolutely incredible. Interestingly, carbonara does not have a long history in the big scheme of famous italian pasta dishes. Some of the first recorded mentions of carbonara pasta were in the 1940s during the American liberation of Rome during WWII, and the first recorded recipes didn’t surface until a few years after that in the early 1950s. However, there are many debating theories about the true origins of the dish that, while I found fascinating, aren’t quite germane to the recipe. I’ll include a link at the bottom for the nerds like me who are curious! Carbonara is at its heart a pretty simple pasta dish, and any classic italian carbonara (in my humble opinion 😉) recipe has no more than 6 ingredients: guanciale (or bacon for those of us who can’t find guanciale), spaghetti, eggs, parmesan, pecorino romano, and fresh black pepper. Notice what’s missing from that list? garlic, onion, cream, and herbs of any sort. Weird for an italian pasta dish right? But honestly this dish doesn’t need it.  To me, any recipe that calls for those ingredients is not a true italian carbonara.  That’s not to say you can’t make a dish tasty by adding them, but I don’t think you can call it a classic carbonara if you do. Pasta alla carbonara is perfectly creamy because of the egg yolk, fatty from the guanciale, rich from the cheese, and with a little bite from the fresh black pepper. What else could you ask for in a pasta dish? Below is a fantastic carbonara recipe if you want to try it out for yourself, and I’ll also include the link for the BA Recipe that started the discussion–its a vegetarian spin on carbonara that uses mushrooms instead of pork. I imagine the dish is pretty tasty and if Brit doesn’t try it out I certainly will be tempted; HOWEVER, in my mind I really struggle to consider it a carbonara because its just got too many things going on that break from the classic carbonara formula. The recipe below is relatively simple (just like the ingredients!), the only tricky part is when you add your egg mixture to the pasta–the best advice I can offer is stir your pasta quickly and stream your egg mixture slowly, and you shouldn’t end up with scrambled egg pasta. Having a second set of hands can definitely help because one person can vigorously mix the pasta while the other is pouring your eggs. Regardless of which variation of carbonara you prefer, happy eating! https://www.thekitchn.com/recipe-authentic-spaghetti-alla-carbonara-recipes-from-the-kitchn-170893 https://www.bonappetit.com/recipe/mushroom-carbonara Spaghetti Alla Carbonara  Ingredients 1 pound dry spaghetti 4 large eggs, as fresh as possible 8 ounces guanciale, pancetta or slab bacon, cubed 1/2 cup freshly grated Parmigiano-Reggiano 1/2 cup freshly grated Pecorino Freshly cracked black pepper Sea salt Directions 1. Bring about 6 quarts of generously salted water (it should be salty when you taste it) to a boil. Add the spaghetti and cook for 8 to 10 minutes or until al dente. When the pasta is done, reserve 1/2 cup of the water, then drain. 2. While the pasta is cooking, heat a large skillet (cast iron works great here) over medium heat. Add the guanciale and sauté for about 3 minutes, or until the meat is crispy and golden and has rendered its fat. Turn off the heat. 3. In a small bowl whisk the eggs and the cheeses until well-combined. 4. Return the guanciale pan to medium heat, and add half of the reserved pasta water to the pan. Toss in the spaghetti and agitate the pan over the heat for a few seconds until the bubbling subsides. Much of the water will evaporate 5. Remove the pan from the heat and add the egg mixture and stirring quickly until the eggs thicken. The residual heat will cook the eggs but you must stir quickly to prevent the eggs from scrambling. If the sauce seems too thick, thin it out with a little bit more of the reserved pasta water. 6. Season liberally with freshly cracked black pepper. Taste for seasoning; depending on the kind of pork used, it may not need any salt. 7. Divide the pasta into bowls and serve immediately.
