<meta name="description" content="Heyo you happy meat eaters! This is a very beloved recipe that I really can’t claim credit for.  As you all know, I am a poor city dweller with no space for a grill :( as a result I struggled to find ways to cook nicer cuts of beef that I don’t want to overcomplicate or overcook.  That’s where this recipe has been a godsend.  All you need is your steak, some butter, and a cast iron (fresh herbs and garlic are a perfect finishing touch). I don’t have much to say about this one, its delicious, fast and easy, and would pair really well if you are making a more complex side dish that requires more of your energy! https://www.myrecipes.com/recipe/pan-seared-strip-steak Pan-Seared Strip Steak Ingredients -2 12-ounce lean, grass-fed New York strip steaks (or whatever steak you purchase) -1 tsp kosher salt -3/4 tsp black pepper -1 tbsp olive oil -2 tbsp butter -2 thyme sprigs (rosemary is also AMAZING) -2 garlic cloves, crushed Directions Let steaks sit for 30 minutes at room temperature. Sprinkle steaks evenly with salt and pepper. Heat large cast iron skillet over high heat.  Add oil to the pan, and swirl to coat. Add steaks to the pan; cook three minutes on each side or until browned.  Reduce heat to medium-low; add butter, thyme, and garlic to pan.  Carefully grasping the pan’s handle, tilt the pan away from you slightly so the butter pools; cook 1 1/2 minutes, constantly basting steaks with butter. Remove steaks from pan; cover loosely with foil. Let stand 10 minutes.  Reserve butter mixture Cut steak across the grain into slices; discard thyme and garlic, and spoon reserved butter mixture over steak." />
