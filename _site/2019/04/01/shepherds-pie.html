<meta name="description" content="My final in this spree of posts is another Alton Brown classic, his shepherd‚Äôs pie.¬† Now this is sacrilegious in a way because true shepherd‚Äôs pie is made with ground lamb, not ground beef. And good old Alton is true to the history of the dish and does call for ground lamb‚ÄìI just ignore it and use ground beef :) So in truth this is a cottage pie variation on Alton Brown‚Äôs shepherds pie (fun fact, that is the main difference between shepherd‚Äôs pie and cottage pie) I‚Äôm not going to include the potato portion because everyone makes mashed potatoes their own way, but I will tell you this recipe calls for 1 1/2 pounds of potatoes in its mashed potato recipe Shepherd‚Äôs Pie Ingredients -use 1 1/2 lbs potatoes to make mashed potatoes for the meat filling 2 tablespoons canola oil 1 cup chopped onion 2 carrots, peeled and diced small 2 cloves garlic, minced 1 1/2 pounds ground lamb (or beef üòù) 1 teaspoon kosher salt 1/2 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper 2 tablespoons all-purpose flour 2 teaspoons tomato paste 1 cup chicken broth 1 teaspoon Worcestershire sauce 2 teaspoons freshly chopped rosemary leaves 1 teaspoon freshly chopped thyme leaves 1/2 cup fresh or frozen corn kernels 1/2 cup fresh or frozen English peas Directions&nbsp; 1. Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F. 2. While your potatoes are cooking, prepare the filling. Place the canola oil into a 12-inch saute pan and set over medium high heat. Once the oil shimmers, add the onion and carrots and saute just until they begin to take on color, approximately 3 to 4 minutes. 3. Add the garlic and stir to combine. Add the lamb, salt and pepper and cook until browned and cooked through, approximately 3 minutes. 4. Sprinkle the meat with the flour and toss to coat, continuing to cook for another minute. Add the tomato paste, chicken broth, Worcestershire, rosemary, thyme, and stir to combine. Bring to a boil, reduce the heat to low, cover and simmer slowly 10 to 12 minutes or until the sauce is thickened slightly. 5. Add the corn and peas to the lamb mixture and spread evenly into an 11 by 7-inch glass baking dish. Top with the mashed potatoes, starting around the edges to create a seal to prevent the mixture from bubbling up and smooth with a rubber spatula. 6. Place on a parchment lined half sheet pan on the middle rack of the oven and bake for 25 minutes or just until the potatoes begin to brown. Remove to a cooling rack for at least 15 minutes before serving. https://www.foodnetwork.com/recipes/alton-brown/shepherds-pie-recipe2-1942900" />

<b>Directions&nbsp;</b></div>

<br />
<div class="MsoNormal">
2. While your potatoes are cooking, prepare the filling.
Place the canola oil into a 12-inch saute pan and set over medium high heat.
Once the oil shimmers, add the onion and carrots and saute just until they
begin to take on color, approximately 3 to 4 minutes. <o:p></o:p></div>

<div class="MsoNormal">
4. Sprinkle the meat with the flour and toss to coat,
continuing to cook for another minute. Add the tomato paste, chicken broth,
Worcestershire, rosemary, thyme, and stir to combine. Bring to a boil, reduce

5. Add the corn and peas to the lamb mixture and spread
evenly into an 11 by 7-inch glass baking dish. Top with the mashed potatoes,
starting around the edges to create a seal to prevent the mixture from bubbling
up and smooth with a rubber spatula. <o:p></o:p></div>

6. Place on a parchment lined half sheet pan on the middle
rack of the oven and bake for 25 minutes or just until the potatoes begin to
