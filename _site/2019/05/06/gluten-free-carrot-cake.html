We found the recipe a few months ago and have been keeping it in our back pocket to use on the most appropriate holiday there is :) I think for purpose of clarity I’ll be using purple font to show my voice, and Brittany can pick another color that way you aren’t confused on who is talking!

There was just a touch too many raisins.&nbsp; My second mistake was because the raisins sucked up a bunch of water when they rehydrated, it follows that they would then lose some of that moisture again in the baking process. This mistake wasn&#39;t critical, but my cake was just a little TOO moist and should have probably been baked a few more minutes to make up for the extra moisture released from the raisins.&nbsp; &nbsp;frosting--I&#39;m not gonna lie, my frosting had some weird stuff going on.&nbsp; I&#39;m not sure if I was messing the recipe up somehow, but my frosting was very loose. I let it firm up in the fridge well enough to frost the cake, but it was just a little to thin to truly pile it on there.&nbsp; Since the frosting is the main source of sweetness in this cake, you want to give the cake a nice and thick coat and I just wasn&#39;t able to do that.&nbsp; However, I don&#39;t think Britt had this problem so I think I maybe just messed it up along the lines somewhere, and it still tasted delicious! Britt Here! Here are my notes on my carrot cake making experience First of all, I used the wrong coconut. I bought shredded coconut instead of the finely ground. It didn&#39;t taste bad, but it was a more prominent flavor profile than I would have liked. It also affected the texture of the cake. I would recommend using the &#39;right&#39; coconut, I won&#39;t do the shredded again. That being said, if you like coconut it might be a welcome change. I cut the&nbsp;quantity of&nbsp;raisins in the cake. I&#39;m not a huge fan of raisins, but I do think that they add an important texture to carrot cake. I did a scant 1/4 cup and it was just about perfect! I think each slice of cake only had a few raisins which is just how [I] like it. My frosting was perfect! I followed the recipe to a T, the full fat yogurt is important I think. The only complaint is that I wish there was more. Next time I will make 1 1/2x the recipe and I will also add a little more sugar. As Hannah noted, overall this recipe isn&#39;t crazy sweet, so I think that adding a little extra sugar to the frosting would not be a problem. The last note is that IMO the recipe needed more walnuts. That, or I just chopped mine too fine. I think I would chop them roughly next time before adding more, 3/4 cup is already a lot I just think that they disappeared into all the other textures. Gluten Free Carrot Cake https://www.bonappetit.com/recipe/gluten-free-carrot-cake Ingredients Cake -1/2 cup virgin coconut oil, melted, plus more for pans -3 cups almond flour, plus more for dusting pans -1 1/2 tsp kosher salt -1 tsp baking powder -1 tsp ground cardamom -1 tsp ground cinnamon -1 tsp ground ginger -1/2 tsp baking soda -5 large eggs -1 1/4 cups packed dark brown sugar -1 tsp vanilla extract -10 oz. carrots, peeled, coarsely shredded, and squeezed firmly to remove excess water -3/4 cup shredded unsweetened coconut -3/4 cup walnuts, finely chopped -1/2 cup golden raisins Frosting -8 oz cream cheese, room temp -1 stick (1/2 cup) unsalted butter, room temp -1 1/4 cup gluten free powdered sugar -1/3 cup greek yogurt -1 tsp vanilla extract -pinch of kosher salt Directions Cake 1. Preheat oven to 350°. Grease two 8&quot; parchment-lined round cake pans with oil, then dust with almond flour, tapping out excess. 2. Whisk salt, baking powder, cardamom, cinnamon, ginger, baking soda, and remaining 3 cups flour in a medium bowl. 3. Using an electric mixer on medium-high speed, beat eggs and brown sugar in a large bowl until more than tripled in volume and mixture holds a ribbon for several seconds when drizzled over itself, 5–7 minutes. (Beating the eggs thoroughly in this stage goes a long way toward creating an aerated, light crumb, which is critical when using gluten-free ingredients.) Beat in vanilla. 4. Toss carrots, coconut, walnuts, raisins, and remaining ½ cup oil in another medium bowl. 5. Reduce mixer speed to low. Add flour mixture in 3 additions, alternating with carrot mixture in 3 additions, to egg mixture, beating well after each addition. 6. Divide batter between prepared pans. Bake cake until lightly browned across the top, a tester inserted into the center comes out clean, and the top springs back when gently poked, 33–36 minutes. Let cool 10 minutes. Carefully run a knife around edges of pans to release cake, then invert onto a wire rack. Let cool completely. Frosting and Assembly 1. Using electric mixer on medium-high speed, beat cream cheese and butter in a large bowl, scraping down as needed, until very smooth, about 2 minutes. Reduce mixer speed to low and add powdered sugar. Beat until combined. Add yogurt, vanilla, and salt and increase speed to medium-high. Beat, scraping down occasionally, until light and airy, about 4 minutes. Chill 10 minutes if needed to stiffen slightly to a spreadable consistently. 2. Arrange one cake round domed side down on a large plate or platter. Cover top and sides with one-third of frosting. Top with remaining cake layer, domed side up. Coat top and sides with remaining frosting. Do Ahead: Cake can be made 3 days ahead. Cover with a cake dome and chill." />

<span style="color: purple;"></span><br />
<a name='more'></a><span style="color: purple;">Overall, I would say this recipe was a homerun.&nbsp; While there were certainly mistakes along the way and tweaks to be made, I absolutely think this recipe deserves a permanent home in the Rowlette Family Recipe box. It was nice to have a cake recipe that doesn't have cups upon cups of sugar in it--this recipe really takes advantage of the natural sweetness of carrots, raisins, and coconut to give you a multi-dimensional dessert experience that doesn't rely on table sugar to give you that sweet, sweeeet sugar rush :)</span><br />
<span style="color: purple;"><br /></span>
<span style="color: purple;">also the reason my cake is weird and has a purple slice is because hunter is a special [demanding] boy and asked [threw a tantrum] for a slice of buttercream frosted carrot cake because he doesn't like cream cheese frosting.&nbsp; And I don't feel even a little bit bad slandering him because he doesn't read the blog 😝</span><br />
<span style="color: purple;"></span><br />
<span style="color: purple;">These are some of my notes from when I made it--Britt will do the same thing below and then we will leave you to the recipe!</span><br />
<br />
<ul>
<li><span style="color: purple;">dusting pans with almond flour is super weird.&nbsp; Because it's so granular in texture it doesn't create as smooth a coat as you would get from wheat flour or even cup-for-cup gluten free flour.&nbsp; it all turned out fine, but just be aware that dusting your pans is funky!</span></li>
<li><span style="color: purple;">raisins--my first mistake was I bought my raisins too far in advance (I was excited, okay?!) and by the time baking day arrived they were as hard as a rock.&nbsp; In my infinite wisdom, I googled how to rehydrate them and it worked like a charm to soften them up, but I followed that wisdom with 2 errors.&nbsp; Because rehydrating the raisins made them bigger, I increased the volume of raisins from the recipe--shouldn't have done that. There was just a touch too many raisins.&nbsp; My second mistake was because the raisins sucked up a bunch of water when they rehydrated, it follows that they would then lose some of that moisture again in the baking process. This mistake wasn't critical, but my cake was just a little TOO moist and should have probably been baked a few more minutes to make up for the extra moisture released from the raisins.&nbsp;</span></li>
<li><span style="color: purple;">&nbsp;frosting--I'm not gonna lie, my frosting had some weird stuff going on.&nbsp; I'm not sure if I was messing the recipe up somehow, but my frosting was very loose. I let it firm up in the fridge well enough to frost the cake, but it was just a little to thin to truly pile it on there.&nbsp; Since the frosting is the main source of sweetness in this cake, you want to give the cake a nice and thick coat and I just wasn't able to do that.&nbsp; However, I don't think Britt had this problem so I think I maybe just messed it up along the lines somewhere, and it still tasted delicious!</span></li>
</ul>
<span style="color: #45818e;">Britt Here! Here are my notes on my carrot cake making experience</span><br />
<ul>
<li><span style="color: #45818e;">First of all, I used the wrong coconut. I bought shredded coconut instead of the finely ground. It didn't taste bad, but it was a more prominent flavor profile than I would have liked. It also affected the texture of the cake. I would recommend using the 'right' coconut, I won't do the shredded again. That being said, if you like coconut it might be a welcome change. </span></li>
<li><span style="color: #45818e;">I cut the&nbsp;quantity of&nbsp;raisins in the cake. I'm not a huge fan of raisins, but I do think that they add an important texture to carrot cake. I did a scant 1/4 cup and it was just about perfect! I think each slice of cake only had a few raisins which is just how [I] like it.</span></li>
<li><span style="color: #45818e;">My frosting was perfect! I followed the recipe to a T, the full fat yogurt is important I think. The only complaint is that I wish there was more. Next time I will make 1 1/2x the recipe and I will also add a little more sugar. As Hannah noted, overall this recipe isn't crazy sweet, so I think that adding a little extra sugar to the frosting would not be a problem. </span></li>
<li><span style="color: #45818e;">The last note is that IMO the recipe needed more walnuts. That, or I just chopped mine too fine. I think I would chop them roughly next time before adding more, 3/4 cup is already a lot I just think that they disappeared into all the other textures. </span></li>

Cake<o:p></o:p></div>
<div>
<div class="MsoNormal">
1. Preheat oven to 350°. Grease two 8" parchment-lined
round cake pans with oil, then dust with almond flour, tapping out excess.</div>
<div class="MsoNormal">
<o:p></o:p><br /></div>
<div class="MsoNormal">
<br /></div>
<div class="MsoNormal">
2. Whisk salt, baking powder, cardamom, cinnamon, ginger,
baking soda, and remaining 3 cups flour in a medium bowl.<o:p></o:p></div>
<div class="MsoNormal">
<br /></div>
<div class="MsoNormal">
3. Using an electric mixer on medium-high speed, beat eggs and
brown sugar in a large bowl until more than tripled in volume and mixture holds
a ribbon for several seconds when drizzled over itself, 5–7 minutes. (Beating
the eggs thoroughly in this stage goes a long way toward creating an aerated,
light crumb, which is critical when using gluten-free ingredients.) Beat in
vanilla.<o:p></o:p></div>
<div class="MsoNormal">
<br /></div>
<div class="MsoNormal">
4. Toss carrots, coconut, walnuts, raisins, and remaining ½ cup
oil in another medium bowl.<o:p></o:p></div>
<div class="MsoNormal">
<br /></div>
<div class="MsoNormal">
5. Reduce mixer speed to low. Add flour mixture in 3 additions,
alternating with carrot mixture in 3 additions, to egg mixture, beating well
after each addition.<o:p></o:p></div>
<div class="MsoNormal">
<br /></div>
<div class="MsoNormal">
6. Divide batter between prepared pans. Bake cake until lightly
browned across the top, a tester inserted into the center comes out clean, and
the top springs back when gently poked, 33–36 minutes. Let cool 10 minutes.
Carefully run a knife around edges of pans to release cake, then invert onto a
wire rack. Let cool completely.</div>

<div class="MsoNormal">
Frosting and Assembly<o:p></o:p></div>
<div class="MsoNormal">
1. Using electric mixer on medium-high speed, beat cream cheese
and butter in a large bowl, scraping down as needed, until very smooth, about 2
minutes. Reduce mixer speed to low and add powdered sugar. Beat until combined.
Add yogurt, vanilla, and salt and increase speed to medium-high. Beat, scraping
down occasionally, until light and airy, about 4 minutes. Chill 10 minutes if
needed to stiffen slightly to a spreadable consistently.</div>
<div class="MsoNormal">
<o:p></o:p><br /></div>
<div class="MsoNormal">
<br /></div>
<div class="MsoNormal">
2. Arrange one cake round domed side down on a large plate or
platter. Cover top and sides with one-third of frosting. Top with remaining
cake layer, domed side up. Coat top and sides with remaining frosting.<o:p></o:p></div>

<div class="MsoNormal">
<b>Do Ahead:</b> Cake
can be made 3 days ahead. Cover with a cake dome and chill.<o:p></o:p></div>
