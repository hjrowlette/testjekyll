<meta name="description" content="This is so good! And so darn fast! I just made this the past Friday and from the time I started until the time we sat down to eat was almost exactly an hour. Granted I only did four chicken thighs but I still love how fast this is. I’ve never used tomatillos before and it makes me wonder what else they would be good in! Chipotle-Rubbed Chicken Sheet-Pan Dinner Ingredients: 12 oz tomatillos (about 6 medium) 8 garlic cloves 4 scallions (I just used half an onion) 1 jalapeno 6 Tbsp EVOO Kosher salt 8 skin-on, bone-in chicken thighs (about 3 lbs) 2 Tbsp. Adobo sauce, from 1 can chipotles in adobo 1 tsp. honey 1 tsp ground cumin, divided 1 medium acorn squash 1/2 bunch cilantro (1/2 cup reserved for serving) Lime wedges (for serving) Directions: Preheat oven to 425. Start by assembling all the ingredients for the salsa. Remove husks from tomatillos and rinse. Cut any larger ones in half and arrange on a baking sheet. Smash garlic and remove skins, add to baking sheet with tomatillos. Trim scallions and cut crosswise into 1” pieces, add to baking sheet. Cut jalapeno in half and remove stem and ribs, place on baking sheet. Drizzle 2 T. oil over vegetables; season with salt. Toss to coat and push veggies to one side of baking sheet, they should be taking up 1/3 of the sheet. Pat 8 chicken thighs dry with paper towels and season with salt. Whisk 2 Tbsp. adobo sauce, 1 tsp honey, 1/2 tsp cumin, and 2 Tbsp. in large bowl until smooth. Add chicken to bowl and toss to coat. Using tongs, arrange chicken skin side up, in center of baking sheet. Place close together to leave enough room for the squash. Cut acorn squash in half and remove seeds. Cut each half in thirds to make 6 wedges. Arrange on baking sheet next to chicken and drizzle with 2 Tbsp. oil, season with salt and pepper and top with remaining cumin. Roast until thighs are browned on top and meat is cooked through, tomatillos are lightly charred on top and squash is fork tender.30-40 minutes. While chicken and squash are cooling tip all the remaining ingredients, along with 1/2 cup of pan juices into a blender. Add cilantro (stems and all) season with a bit more salt. Blend and thin with more pan juices as needed. Top with any remaining cilantro and lime wedges. Until next time, happy eating! https://www.bonappetit.com/recipe/chipotle-rubbed-chicken-sheet-pan-dinner" />

This is so good! And so darn fast! I just made this the past Friday and from the time I started until the time we sat down to eat was almost exactly an hour. Granted I only did four chicken thighs but I still love how fast this is. I've never used tomatillos before and it makes me wonder what else they would be good in!<br />

<br />
Ingredients:<br />
12 oz tomatillos (about 6 medium)<br />
8 garlic cloves<br />
4 scallions (I just used half an onion)<br />
1 jalapeno<br />
6 Tbsp EVOO<br />
Kosher salt<br />
8 skin-on, bone-in chicken thighs (about 3 lbs)<br />
2 Tbsp. Adobo sauce, from 1 can chipotles in adobo<br />
1 tsp. honey<br />
1 tsp ground cumin, divided<br />
1 medium acorn squash<br />
1/2 bunch cilantro (1/2 cup reserved for serving)<br />
Lime wedges (for serving)<br />
<br />
Directions:<br />
<br />
Preheat oven to 425. Start by assembling all the ingredients for the salsa. Remove husks from tomatillos and rinse. Cut any larger ones in half and arrange on a baking sheet. Smash garlic and remove skins, add to baking sheet with tomatillos. Trim scallions and cut crosswise into 1" pieces, add to baking sheet. Cut jalapeno in half and remove stem and ribs, place on baking sheet. Drizzle 2 T. oil over vegetables; season with salt. Toss to coat and push veggies to one side of baking sheet, they should be taking up 1/3 of the sheet.<br />
<br />
Pat 8 chicken thighs dry with paper towels and season with salt. Whisk 2 Tbsp. adobo sauce, 1 tsp honey, 1/2 tsp cumin, and 2 Tbsp. in large bowl until smooth. Add chicken to bowl and toss to coat. Using tongs, arrange chicken skin side up, in center of baking sheet. Place close together to leave enough room for the squash.<br />
<br />
Cut acorn squash in half and remove seeds. Cut each half in thirds to make 6 wedges. Arrange on baking sheet next to chicken and drizzle with&nbsp;2 Tbsp.&nbsp;oil, season with salt and pepper and top with remaining cumin.<br />
<br />
Roast until thighs are browned on top and meat is&nbsp;cooked through, tomatillos are lightly charred on top and&nbsp;squash is fork tender.30-40 minutes. While chicken&nbsp;and squash are cooling tip all the remaining ingredients, along with 1/2 cup of pan juices into a blender. Add cilantro (stems and all) season with a bit more salt. Blend and thin with more pan juices as needed. Top with&nbsp;any remaining cilantro&nbsp;and lime wedges.<br />
