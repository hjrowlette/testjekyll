<meta name="description" content="This recipe y&#39;all. Whoa boy. It is SO good! BA describes it as meaty tomato sauce meets pad kee mao (drunken noodles), but when I tasted it I knew what it was very similar too. Blog fam, allow me to introduce Asian style cowboy spaghetti. Yeah that&#39;s right! It has so many similarities in the meaty tomato heartiness, but the flavors are just so different. It was very easy, if not the fastest since the sauce needs to cook for about 45 minutes. ﻿ Ingredients: 2 Tbsp. EVOO 2 lb. ground pork, divided* 1 2” piece fresh ginger, peeled, cut into thin matchsticks or finely chopped 8 cloves garlic, thinly sliced 2 Tbsp. sugar 2 Tbsp. tomato paste 2 sprigs basil 1/3 c. hot chili paste (such as sambal oelek) 1/4 c. soy sauce 1/4 c. unsweetened rice vinegar 1 1/2 lb. fresh ramen noodles Salt 2 Tbsp. unsalted butter Directions: Heat oil in a large heavy pot over medium-high heat. Add half of pork to pot, breaking into 6-8 large chunks with a wooden spoon. Cook, undisturbed, until well browned underneath, about 5 minutes. Turn pieces and continue to cook, turning occasionally, until pork is browned on 2-3 sides, about 5 minutes more. Add ginger, garlic, sugar and remaining pork to pot and cook. Breaking up pork into small clumps until meat is nearly cooked through, about 5 minutes longer. Add tomato paste and 2 basil sprigs. Cook, stirring occasionally, until paste darkens, about 2 minutes. Add chili paste, soy sauce, rice vinegar, and 2 cups water. Bring to simmer, reduced heat to low, and cook uncovered until sauce is slightly thickened and flavors have melded, 30-45 minutes. Cook noodles in large pot of boiling salted water, sitting occasionally, until 1 minutes short of al dente. Add to pot with sauce along with butter and a splash of the pasta cooking liquid. Simmer, tossing occasionally, until sauce begins to cling to noodles, about 1 minutes. Puck out basil and serve with additional fresh basil on top. My notes: I couldn’t find 2 pounds of ground pork, the package I got was 1.25 lbs. and I deemed it sufficient and went with it. The method of browning the pork seems odd, but the reason is you really don’t need to batch it to be able to brown it all. As long as you brown about half the flavor will carry over enough that doing two batches just isn’t worth it. This is probably one of the only recipes where I didn’t add salt. I tasted as the sauce cooked and between the soy sauce and the chili paste, it was salty enough! I also didn’t add black pepper, it didn’t seem to need it. I only cooked enough noodles for one meal so I didn’t mix them into the sauce, I tossed them in a large bowl with the little bit of pasta water and served from there. I also didn’t add the butter, the pork was so fatty it seemed unnecessary. I also didn’t have fresh basil and use dried but next time I will definitely get fresh. I bet it makes a huge difference, especially on top of the finished bowls. Until next time, Happy eating!" />
