<meta name="description" content="At the behest of our dear mother, I am getting this recipe posted so that we donâ€™t have to go searching for it among PaleoRunningMommas 13,000 other stuffed squash recipes ðŸ˜‰ Not much to say, follow the recipe and happy eating! Recipe Link:Â https://www.paleorunningmomma.com/sausage-stuffed-acorn-squash-paleo-whole30/ Ingredients 2 small/medium acorn squash, cut in half lengthwise and seeds/pulp removed 1 lb pork sausage, casings removed if necessary 1 large onion or 2 small onions, cut in half and sliced thinly 3 tbsp ghee coconut oil, or other cooking fat (for caramelizing the onions) and 2 tspÂ  (for sauteing garlic) 2 cloves garlic, minced 1 medium/large apple cored and diced 2 cups fresh spinach roughly chopped 1 tbsp fresh rosemary chopped 2 tsp fresh thyme chopped sea salt and black pepper to taste Directions 1. Preheat your oven to 400 degrees and line a baking sheet with parchment paper. 2. Place the 4 acorn squash halves (seeds removed) cut-side down on the baking sheet and roast in the preheated oven for about 20-30 minutes, or until the top of your squash feels tender when gently pressed. You can always check them and continue to roast a few more minutes if they aren&#39;t tender enough. Set aside after removing from oven. 3. While the squash roasts, make the filling. Begin by caramelizing the onions (this process takes a good 20-25 minutes to really bring the flavor out!) In a medium skillet, heat the ghee or coconut oil over low heat and add all the onions, stirring to coat. Sprinkle with a bit of salt and cook over low heat, stirring every 5 minutes ago to prevent burning. Once onions have been cooking for about 25 minutes and are deep golden brown, remove from heat and set aside. 4. While the squash roasts and the onions cook, heat a large saucepan over medium low heat and add the remaining 2 tsp cooking fat to melt. Add the garlic and cook until just tender, then add all the sausage and increase the heat to medium. 5. Cook the sausage and stir to break up lumps, about 5-8 minutes until just browned. Add the apples and herbs and continue to cook, stirring until the apples soften. Add the spinach and a pinch of salt and pepper and cook, stirring, until the spinach wilts. Add the caramelized onions to the sausage mixture, leaving excess cooking fat in the pan.&nbsp; 6. Preheat your broiler, then fill all 4 halves of the squash with the stuffing mixture (you may have leftover depending on how big your squash was). Arrange the squash on the baking sheet, stuffing side up, and put under the broiler for 5-10 minutes until the tops get nice and toasty, checking often to prevent burning. Once nice and browned, remove from oven, allow to cool a bit and then serve warm. Enjoy!" />
