<meta name="description" content="Its Oh boy time again… BA hit the big time in my books with this out of this world garlic friend rice recipe.  if you like garlic, it is genetically impossible to hate this recipe.  it comes together fairly easily, doesn’t require a bunch of crazy ingredients, and just makes you want to melt into a puddle. My only complaint is that this is definitely a night-of recipe.  I’ve had it twice as leftovers and it just is a sad ghost of its former glory.  Also its terrible for work environment because hello? it has like a ridiculous amount of garlic!  anyways enough of me gabbing, here comes the food train! Ingredients 8 cloves garlic, thinly sliced 1/3 cup vegetable oil kosher salt 1 2” piece of ginger, peeled and finely chopped 1 large egg, beaten to blend 3 cups chilled cooked short-grain rice 2 tsp. toasted sesame oil 4 scallions, thinly sliced on the diagonal 3/4 cup coarsely chopped cilantro 2 tsp toasted sesame seeds As a note, I literally never have sesame so I ignore both the oil and the seeds–if you have them great, and if not just press on without! Directions 1. Toss garlic and vegetable oil in a large nonstick skillet. Arrange garlic in a single layer and set over medium heat. Cook, shaking pan often, until garlic is barely golden and crisp (oil should stop bubbling at this point), about 5 minutes. Using a slotted spoon, transfer garlic chips to paper towels to drain; season with salt. Increase heat to medium-high and cook ginger in oil in the same skillet, stirring occasionally, until just softened and fragrant, about 2 minutes. 3. Add egg and stir to break up; cook until just set (this will take a matter of seconds).&nbsp; 4. Add rice and sesame oil and toss to combine. Cook, undisturbed, pressing down on rice with a spatula so it makes good contact with the pan, until rice begins to crisp, about 2 minutes. Give rice a toss, then press down on it again, cooking until you get more crispy bits, about 2 minutes.&nbsp; 5. Remove skillet from heat and toss in scallions and half of garlic chips; season with salt. 6. Transfer fried rice to a platter and scatter cilantro, sesame seeds, and remaining garlic chips on top" />
