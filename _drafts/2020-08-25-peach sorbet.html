<p>&nbsp;</p><p>-I used unripe peaches. Mainly because I'm impatient and was too excited to try the recipe to wait for them to ripen</p><p>-I didn't peel my peaches; there were definitely bits of skin that kept from achieving a smooth texture, but I didn't mind that. If you want a perfectly smooth sorbet either use a high powered blender than can process the skins, or peel your peaches. I also was using an immersion blender attachment so a better blender may have done a better job on the skins.</p><p>-</p>
