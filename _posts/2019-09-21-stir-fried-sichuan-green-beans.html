<span style="font-family: inherit;">This recipe has great flavor, comes together really quickly, and would go great with the sechuan noodles, over some white rice, or all by themself!</span><br />

<b>Ingredients:</b><br />
2 tbsp soy sauce<br />
2 tbsp water<br />
1 tbsp dry sherry<br />
1 tsp sugar<br />
1/2 tsp cornstarch<br />
1/4 tsp ground white pepper<br />
1/4 tsp red pepper flakes<br />
1/4 tsp dry ground mustard<br />
2 tbsp vegetable oil<br />
1 lb green beans, trimmed and cut into pieces<br />
1/4 lb ground pork<br />

1. Stir together soy sauce, water, sherry, sugar, cornstarch, white pepper, pepper flakes, and dry mustard in small bowl until sugar dissolves.<br />
<br />
2. Heat oil in a nonstick skillet over high heat until just smoking.&nbsp; Add beans and cook, stirring frequently, until crisp-tender and skins are shriveled and blackened in spots, 5-8 minutes.&nbsp; Transfer beans to a large plate.<br />
