This is SO GOOD. Yet again BA strikes again with golden content. This pancake makes such an amazing base for almost anything. I'm a huge fan of combining it with smashed oven roasted eggplant and topping with full fat Greek yogurt mixed with olive oil, garlic, parsley, salt and pepper. I'm really curious to try it with any other roasted veggies and a fried egg. Or as a substitute for naan with Indian food. I bet it would make a great carrier for tikka masala! It could even double as a pizza base! There's no limiting what you can try with this little angel. Get creative and get back to me!<br />
<a name='more'></a>There's no leavening here so this stays very flat but it can get gorgeously crispy. The batter for this recipe makes enough for two...but it won't keep cooked in the fridge very well. Unless you're a fan of the crispy gone soggy texture.&nbsp; If in doubt, just make one and save the rest of the batter for lunch or dinner the next day! On that note, more time is better when the batter is made. The chickpea (aka garbanzo bean) flour needs plenty of time to hydrate, otherwise it will be gritty and bitter. Make it as soon as you start dinner prep and start it cooking once everything else is pulled together!<br />
<br />
It's just this simple:<br />
<br />
1/2 c. chickpea flour<br />
1 Tbsp oil<br />
1/2 c. water<br />
salt<br />
<br />
Let batter sit at least 10 minutes or up to 1 hour to let flour hydrate. Heat 1 1/2 tsp oil in skilled over medium-high. Add half of batter and tilt so it spreads into a thin pancake. Cook undisturbed until well browned and crisp underneath, 2/3 minutes. Increase heat to high if needed to get crunchy edges and browning. Turn and cook just until lightly browned on second side, about 1 minutes. Transfer toa plate. Repeat with remaining batter.<br />
<br />
Until next time,<br />
Happy eating!<br />
