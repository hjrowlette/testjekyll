So I had a very interesting Saturday this weekend. My plan for the day was a lazy morning followed by a stroll to the grocery store followed by an afternoon and evening of baking some tarts. However, that got a little derailed when I ended up spending 5 hours at the hospital with my poor roommate. Now he will be totally fine, but as you all know spending any amount of time in the hospital is stressful and draining and the best recovery for that is some serious comfort food.<br />

I flagged this recipe a week or two ago when it popped up on Bon Appetit's website, and let me tell you. It. Delivered.&nbsp; It was the ultimate version of a grilled ham and cheese sandwich that was ridiculously decadent, easy to pull together, and the edible equivalent of being burrito-rolled inside a heated blanket. I was so excited to eat it I didn't stop to save the picture I took.<br />
<br />
However, with great power comes great responsibility--what makes this recipe amazing is that you can't skimp on your ingredients.&nbsp; You need some decent gruyere, thin sliced ham, and at a minimum whole milk for your bechamel. As a result of this decadence, its not your weekly sandwich go-to.&nbsp; This is definitely a special occasion sandwich.&nbsp; This recipe is perfect and I didn't change a thing, although I think if you did want to add a little glimpse of green you could toss on some fresh arugula or spinach after you bake it, but it certainly doesn't need anything else.<br />

<br />
<b>Ingredients</b><br />
-for the bechamel-<br />
1/4 cup (1/2 stick) unsalted butter<br />
1/2 cup all-purpose flour<br />
1 1/2 cups whole milk<br />
2 tablespoons whole grain mustard (I used dijon)<br />
kosher salt<br />
<br />
-assembly-<br />
8 slices 1/2" thick country-style bread (I used sourdough)<br />
6 oz. ham, preferably paris ham (I have no clue what paris ham is, I just got deli ham)<br />
3 oz. gruyere, grated (about 1 1/2 cups)<br />
1 teaspoon herbes de Provence<br />
<br />
<b>Directions</b><br />
-for the bechamel-<br />
1. Melt butter in medium saucepan over medium heat until foamy.&nbsp; Add flour and cook, stirring, until mixture is pale and foamy, about 3 minutes.<br />
<br />
2. Gradually add milk, stirring until mixture is smooth. Cooking, constantly stirring, until sauce is thick and somewhat elastic, about 4 minutes (it will elasticize more after its off the heat so don't overdo it looking for that property)<br />
<br />
3. Remove from heat and whisk in mustard, season with salt.<br />
(Bechamel can be made 1 day ahead. Let cool; press plastic wrap directly on surface and chill)<br />
<br />
-assembly-<br />
1. Preheat oven to 425. Spread bread slices with bechamel, dividing evenly and extending the sauce all the way to the edges.<br />
<br />
2. Place 4 slices of bread, bechamel side up, on a parchment-lined baking sheet; top with ham and half of gruyere.<br />
<br />
3. Top with remaining slices of bread, bechamel side up, then top with remaining cheese and sprinkle with herbs de provence.<br />
<br />
4. Bake until cheese is brown and bubbling, 10-15 minutes<br />
<br />
(Sandwiches can be made (but not baked) 1 day ahead; cover and chill)
