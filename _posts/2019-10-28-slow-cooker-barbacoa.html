This was a new one for me folks. I knew I wanted tender flavorful beef to put in my tacos, but wasn't sure about my cooking method and ingredients. I combined and modified what google had to offer and made a slow cooker barbacoa that is everything I wanted and more. Perfect for feeding large crowds or freezing into individual portions. Every night is taco night if you make enough!<br />

Ingredients:<br />
6 lb chuck roast ( I used two roasts, this could easily be halved)<br />
1 small can chipotle peppers in adobo<a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEjl9zk9-BQswThGEJEAj9zgtqPq6dyRMasPmcc0i50uOvyrWybfbc0iB24HGrecGqATMac6GNTE4BaYUUrw8FfQQ7Xvk6SZqQVJVuxxfGlLFX9x7xHRUuRxZClRorJM3z4mHGxkFXV7rg/s1600/Slow-Cooker-Barbacoa-Beef-10.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="-webkit-text-stroke-width: 0px; clear: right; color: #0066cc; float: right; font-family: Times New Roman; font-size: 16px; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; font-weight: 400; letter-spacing: normal; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em; orphans: 2; text-align: center; text-decoration: underline; text-indent: 0px; text-transform: none; white-space: normal; word-spacing: 0px;"><img border="0" data-original-height="1600" data-original-width="1067" height="320" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEjl9zk9-BQswThGEJEAj9zgtqPq6dyRMasPmcc0i50uOvyrWybfbc0iB24HGrecGqATMac6GNTE4BaYUUrw8FfQQ7Xvk6SZqQVJVuxxfGlLFX9x7xHRUuRxZClRorJM3z4mHGxkFXV7rg/s320/Slow-Cooker-Barbacoa-Beef-10.jpg" style="cursor: move;" width="212" /></a><br />
1 medium yellow onion, quartered<br />
5 cloves of garlic<br />
10 oz beef broth<br />
1 Tbl cumin<br />
1 Tbl chili powder<br />
1 Tbl oregano<br />
1/3 c. lime juice<br />
2-3 bay leaves<br />
<br />
Directions:<br />
Cut each roast into six large pieces. Pat dry with paper towels and salt and pepper generously. Meanwhile, heat vegetable oil in a dutch oven until almost smoking. Sear pieces of roast until heavily browned on all sides. Be sure not to crowd the pan, you'll have to work in batches. I recommend three pieces at a time adding more oil as needed. Once browned, transfer beef to slow cooker and finish searing the rest of the meat. Once the meat is done add bay leaves to the slow cooker and combine all other ingredients in a blender, puree until smooth. Add sauce into slow cooker and toss to combine. Cook on low heat for 8 - 10 hours. Meat should shred with very little effort. Remove bay leaves and shred meat, pulling out any large pieces of fat and discarding. Return shredded beef to slow cooker and cook an additional hour in the sauce. Serve with rice, black beans, on a taco, in enchiladas, however you want!<br />

Some notes:<br />
<br />
I made this up as I went, I didn't measure anything. These measurements are a guideline, feel free to add more or less of anything. Ultimately the goal is to get really good color on the beef, and make sure there is plenty of thick sauce for it to cook in. Next time I will try adding some ground cloves and maybe a jalapeno or rehydrated ancho chili to the sauce. Taste as you go and adjust salt as needed.<br />

Until next time, happy eating!
