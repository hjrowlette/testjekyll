<p>&nbsp;oh baby! This is one of my favorite dishes to get at restaurants because before now I've never made it myself but I always love to eat it. I won't call this recipe perfect because I definitely want to tweak it some more, but this is pretty darn close and still super tasty so strap in and get ready for some southern comfort eating!</p><p></p><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: right;"><object class="BLOG_video_class" contentid="b5d31fe553a59fe7" height="266" id="BLOG_video-b5d31fe553a59fe7" width="320"></object></div><br /><p></p><p><b>Shrimp and Grits</b></p><p><b>Ingredients</b></p><p>1 cup dry grits&nbsp;</p><p>4 cups water</p><p>2 cups shredded cheese (I used white cheddar)</p><p>2 tbsp butter</p><p>6 slices thick-cut bacon, chopped</p><p>1 lb of shrimp, shelled and deveined</p><p>3 cloves garlic<br /></p><p>2 tsp lemon juice (fresh best)</p><p>cayenne</p><p>1 tsp fresh parsley, chopped</p><p>3 scallions, sliced</p><p><br /></p><p><b>Directions</b></p><p>1.
