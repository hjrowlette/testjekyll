<b>OH. BOY.</b></div>
<br />
Let me tell you something--I never cook pasta. Literally never. Rice? Occasionally. Potatoes? Every once in a while. Pasta? Dream on.&nbsp; I don't know why but unless its preboxed macaroni and cheese, you won't see me cooking pasta!<br />
<br />
That has all changed because of this recipe.&nbsp; For such a small ingredient list, this recipe is so so tasty that you will probably find yourself eating a disgusting quantity, moaning all the while.&nbsp; Well, that's what I did. And still had lunch for 3 days after that.<br />

<br />
Like many pasta-with-sauce recipes, this definitely has the best texture the day you make it, but the next day taste is just as good as it is the night of, which is why it will make the list of leftover favorites.<br />
<br />

<br />
I didn't change a thing from the Bon Appetit recipe, and I don't think I ever will.&nbsp; Super quick, super easy, and the taste is perfect! Enjoy :)<br />

<br />
<b>Ingredients:</b><br />
Kosher Salt<br />
1 medium onion<br />
4 garlic cloves<br />
4 oz Parmesan cheese<br />
2 tbsp EVOO, plus more for drizzling<br />
1 4.5oz tube double-concentrated tomato paste<br />
1/2 tsp red pepper flakes<br />
2 oz vodka<br />
3/4 cup heavy cream<br />
1 lb rigatoni<br />
basil leaves (for serving)<br />
<br />
<br />
<b>Directions:</b><br />
1. Fill stock pot 3/4 full with water and heat over high. Toss in handful of salt and bring to boil while do complete other prep<br />
<br />
2. Peel and finely chop 1 onion<br />
<br />
3. Firmly smash 4 garlic cloves with flat side of chef's knife and remove peel<br />
<br />
4. Grate 4oz Parmesan on smallest holes of grater<br />
<br />
5. Heat 2 Tbsp EVOO in dutch oven over medium heat. Add onion and garlic and cook, stirring constantly, until onion is starting to brown around edges, 5-7 minutes<br />
<br />
6. Add entire 4.5oz tube of tomato paste and 1/2 tsp red pepper flakes and stir until paste even coats onion.&nbsp; Continue to cook, stirring often, until paste is deep red and starting to brown on bottom of pot, 5-7 minutes<br />
<br />
7. Add 2 oz vodka to deglaze pan and stir to incorporate, scraping bottom of pot. Reduce heat to low.<br />
<br />
8. Using heatproof glass measuring cup, scoop about 1/4 cup boiling water from stock pot, then add 3/4 cup heavy cream to measuring cup (this brings up temperature of the cream so it won't break when you add it to the dutch oven).<br />
<br />
9. Slowly add warmed cream to dutch oven, stirring constantly, until a smooth sauce forms. Remove from heat.<br />
<br />
10. Add 1lb rigatoni to boiling salted water and cook according to package instructions until al dente.&nbsp; About 1 minute before the timer goes off, use heatproof measuring cup to scoop about 1 cup pasta cooking liquid. Return dutch oven to low heat<br />
<br />
11. Using a spider (or slotted spoon), transfer rigatoni to dutch oven, dont worry about any extra water that gets into the dutch oven with the pasta<br />
<br />
12. Add 1/2 cup pasta cooking liquid to dutch oven and stir to incorporate, then gradually add half of Parmesan, stirring constantly to melt cheese.You should have a smooth, glossy sauce that coats each piece of pasta. Season with salt and add a splash more pasta cooking liquid to thin the sauce if needed<br />
<br />
13. Serve pasta, topping with remaining Parmesan. Drizzle with EVOO and tear basil leaves for garnish.
