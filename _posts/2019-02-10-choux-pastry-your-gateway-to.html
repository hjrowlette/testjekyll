It's time for another baking recipe tested and approved by one of your resident recipe testers!!<br />
<br />
Choux pastry, or pate a choux, is a light pastry dough used to make a variety of fancy pastries--as I've mentioned above it can be used for profiteroles, eclairs, and gougeres, but can also make croquembouches, beignets, and so much more.&nbsp; The key feature of choux pastry is its limited list of ingredients--egg, water, flour, and butter.<br />
<br />
<br />
Once all these ingredients are combined, the choux pastry is piped or shaped and while it is baking the water will turn to steam, causing your pastry to rise and form a light, airy, and usually hollow shell. It can then be filled with pastry cream, whipped cream, or savory foods to create a variety of treats.<br />
<br />
I came to the recipe below after consulting a multitude of online blogs and recipes, with one in particular being very helpful. The Flavor Bender put together an excellent guide about choux pastry, so I'm going to link them below and avoid reiterating everything they have discussed.<br />

<br />
They have great background information about choux as well as a troubleshooting guide about what may be the source of any problems if your dough isn't working.<br />

Two parts water, one part butter, one part flour, and two parts egg.&nbsp; What the Flavor Bender recommends is adding the smallest amount of extra flour, and I can confirm it works great.&nbsp; So for example, their recipe calls for 8 oz water, 4 oz butter, 4.5 oz flour, and 8 oz egg.<br />
<br />
Anyways, there isn't much more for me to yammer on about, so I'll leave you and the recipe (with variations for profiteroles, gougeres, eclairs, and gluten free) to get acquainted ðŸ˜‰ happy eating!<br />
<br />
<b>Ingredients</b><br />
8 oz / 226 g water<br />
4 oz / 113 g unsalted butter (cubed and room temperature)<br />
4.5 oz / 130 flour, sifted<br />
8 oz / 226 g egg (4 large eggs)<br />
pinch of salt<br />
1 tbsp sugar (optional)<br />
1/2 tsp vanilla (optional)<br />
2 cups grated cheese (optional)<br />
<br />
<b>Directions</b><br />
1. Preheat oven to 375Â°. Combine butter, water, salt, and sugar in saucepan and place over medium heat.&nbsp; Stir occasionally until water just starts to boil (butter should be melted)<br />
<br />
2. Remove saucepan from heat and add all the flour to the saucepan, mixing vigorously so it absorbs all the water.&nbsp; Return to medium heat<br />
<br />
3. Cook dough for 2-5 minutes, mixing constantly, until dough pulls from the side of the pan and forms oil drops on the surface, and small metal spoon can stand straight up in the dough<br />
<br />
4. Transfer dough to a bowl and let cool slightly for a few minutes<br />
<br />
5. Add vanilla and stir to incorporate. With mixer or whisk, mix dough while adding eggs one at a time (lightly beat eggs in small bowl before adding), mixing well after each addition<br />
<br />
6. Stop adding egg immediately when your dough has a glossy sheen and pipeable consistency (may take a little more or less than 4 eggs, which is why you beat them first)<br />
<br />
7. Prep baking tray with parchment paper, and mist surface of parchment paper with a small amount of water<br />
<br />
8. Pipe dough in circles onto baking sheet and flatten apex with a damp finger so the top is smooth<br />
<br />
9. Bake 30-40 minutes (DO NOT OPEN OVEN DOOR BEFORE 30-40 MINUTES HAVE GONE BY.&nbsp; Opening the oven door would release the steam that causes the pate a choux to rise). Remove tray from oven and prick shell with toothpick. Let cool<br />
<br />
10. Fill immediately or store in an airtight container for 1 day.<br />
<br />
<b>Profiteroles (Cream Puffs)</b><br />
Ensure you add both the vanilla and the sugar to the pate a choux.&nbsp; Then, fill with whipped cream, creme patisserie, or anything else of your choice<br />
<br />
<b>Gougeres</b><br />
Omit the vanilla and sugar, and increase the salt to 1 tsp. Follow the pate a choux recipe; after incorporating eggs, stir in 1 1/2 cups of high quality grated gruyere, comte, or other cheese.<br />
<br />
After piping onto baking sheet, sprinkle a little more cheese on top of each gougere.<br />
<br />
You can also sprinkle a little herbs de provence on top of the piped gougere or other spice mix if you would like.&nbsp; (highly recommend)<br />
<br />
***In my experience, gougeres do not store well--use immediately*** If you do want to store, freeze and then reheat in the oven.&nbsp; <br />
<br />
I have read that these do freeze well in their unbaked form, but I haven't tried it myself.&nbsp; I would recommend piping them on parchment paper, freezing them, and then putting them in a ziploc bag. To bake, remove from freezer and follow baking instructions, it would probably take closer to 40 minutes.<br />
<br />
<b>Eclairs</b><br />
Follow same directions as profiteroles, but rather than piping circles, pipe strips of pate a choux.&nbsp; After they come out of the oven, cut 2-3 holes along the bottom of the eclair and pipe in each hole to fill, using creme patisserie or whipped cream.<br />
<br />
<b>Gluten Free</b><br />
I recently attempted these as gluten free, and they came out really well! I used King Arthur Cup-for-Cup Gluten Free Flour and followed the exact directions above.<br />
<br />
The only problem I ran across is that after I added the flour and put the pot back on the stove, it had been less than 2 minutes and the oil started seeping out of the choux too quickly, and a spoon wouldn't stand in it as it should.<br />
<br />
I removed the choux from the heat and added an additional spoonful of flour, and it went right back to the correct consistency.<br />

</tbody></table>
<br />
I'm not sure if it was simply because the flour interacted differently with the water and butter, or if I just messed up the recipe, but it fixed itself with relative ease.&nbsp; If you try it and something does seem to go wrong, I would definitely check the FlavorBender link for their troubleshooting guide.<br />
<br />
I've included some photos below, hope these help!<br />
