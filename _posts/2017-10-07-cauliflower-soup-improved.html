Welcome back to another episode of Hannah Talks to Herself, brought to you by the maker of Game of Thrones, HBO!! Just kidding, if HBO sponsored this blog there would be violence or nudity. All that is here is food<br />
<br />

When I was in Zurich I had dinner at a restaurant and ate an AMAZING cauliflower soup as an appetizer (picture below!), and I am determined to recreate it!&nbsp; The recipe didn't come out perfectly the first time, but part of that was my fault.<br />
<br />
<br />
ANYWAYS, I decided to take another stab at the cauliflower soup recipe because I was pretty disappointed in how it had come out last time, and let me tell you--the second attempt was a BIG improvement.&nbsp; The soup was much more flavorful and the texture was a lot better, so I am very happy to share the updated version!<br />

<br />
<br />
Changes from the first recipe (which no longer is on this site) are that I included celery and carrot, partially exchanged olive oil for butter, used more salt and pepper as well as herbs de provence instead of fresh thyme ( but still used some thyme).&nbsp; I also increased the cheese and added some sharp white cheddar (honestly it's just because I happened to have it in the fridge).&nbsp; I also added some white pepper and chili flakes at the end! You can see the goal was mostly just trying to pack more flavor into the soup where I could.<br />

<li>1 medium head cauliflower</li>
<li>1 celery stalk, chopped small</li>
<li>1 carrot, grated</li>
<li>1 tablespoon EVOO</li>
<li>1 tablespoon salted butter</li>
<li>1 large white onion, peeled and diced</li>
<li>5 cloves garlic, minced</li>
<li>3 cups Chicken Stock</li>
<li>1/2 tsp (heaping) Herbs de Provence</li>
<li>Dash of thyme</li>
<li>3/4 cup freshly-grated parmesan cheese</li>
<li>1/3 cup grated sharp white cheddar cheese</li>
<li>3 cups milk&nbsp;<span style="font-size: 14px;"><i>(I used 2%)</i></span></li>
<li>white pepper (optional)</li>
<li>chili flakes (optional)</li>
</ul>

</div>
<li>Begin by prepping your cauliflower. &nbsp;Remove and discard the outer leaves and trim off the stem.&nbsp; Roughly chop the cauliflower into smaller, bite sized pieces.</li>
<li>Heat oil and butter in a large stockpot over medium-high heat. &nbsp;Add the onion, celery, and carrot and sauté for 5 minutes, until soft and translucent, stirring occasionally. &nbsp;Stir in the garlic and continue to sauté for 1-2 more minutes, until fragrant. Add the chopped cauliflower and sauté&nbsp;another 1-2 minutes.</li>
<li>Add&nbsp;in chicken stock, herbs de provence, and thyme and stir to combine. &nbsp;Continue cooking until the mixture reaches a simmer. &nbsp;Then reduce heat to medium-low, cover, and continue simmering for about 20-25 minutes, or until the cauliflower is tender.&nbsp;</li>
<li>Using either an immersion blender or transferring the soup in batches to a traditional blender (be careful not to fill it very full when working with hot soups), puree the soup until smooth.</li>
<li>Stir in the parmesan and cheddar until melted, then add milk.</li>
<li>Season the soup to taste with&nbsp;salt, white pepper, or chili flakes as you like.</li>
<li>If soup has cooled from adding the milk, put back on low heat until soup is warmed through, stirring regularly.&nbsp;</li>
</ol>

There you have it, new and improved cauliflower soup!&nbsp; It's not the heartiest soup but it would work really well as an appetizer or a side to a meat or vegetable dish in place of a grain :)&nbsp;</div>
