Hold on, I know, why would I put two&nbsp; different sichaun recipes the same night? They would taste the same! WELL HOLD YOUR HORSES BECAUSE YOU ARE VERY WRONG.<br />
<br />
These two recipes are perfectly complimentary but very different at the same time. The noodles are nutty and umami, whereas the green beans are spicy and crisp. They are the perfect duo :)<br />
<br />
I know this recipe says Spicy, but honestly it didn't have too much heat. Definitely recommend if you want more spice to increase the white pepper and the red pepper flakes!<br />
