Happy New Year!! Hopefully everyone survived the holiday season without exploding from too many holiday treats, and in the new year is ready to try a fantastic new recipe that is a tasty twist on a familiar meal.<br />
<br />
I came across this recipe, and this website, while searching for ways to broaden my culinary horizon.&nbsp; The woman who runs the blog where I found this recipe made it her goal to prepare a dish from every country in the world, and that is pretty darn impressive if you ask me.&nbsp; It's called Global Table Adventure, and I'll include a link to both the kofta recipe and the homepage of her website.<br />

Kofta is a fairly common Middle Eastern dish that has a lot of different spins on it, and the one below originates from Oman.&nbsp; While its definitely a summer-y dish, it is also tasty and enjoyable year round! The variety of fresh herbs give incredible depth of flavor to the kofta as well as the sauce, while the cumin, coriander, and red pepper flakes add a whole different dimension to make this a dish your tastebuds will enjoy!<br />
<br />
The only things I do differently from her recipe is that I leave out the cinnamon--the first time I made it I did include it, and while its good I have weird opinions about cinnamon in savory food. And not having a grill, I cook my kofta in a cast iron--one of these days I'm going to try and make them more meatball style in the oven, but for now they get beautifully browned on my stove top. I always serve with rice, but the majority of your plate should be the delicious zucchini sauce ðŸ˜‹<br />
<br />
This recipe is quick, easy, and makes for great leftovers.&nbsp; It's the perfect dish to eat garden-fresh in the summer, and in the winter it can help remind you that warmer days will always come back sooner than you think!<br />

<li>1lb ground beef -or- ground lamb</li>
<li>1 tbsp parsley, finely chopped</li>
<li>1 tbsp fresh cilantro, finely chopped</li>
<li>1 tiny red onion, minced</li>
<li>1 tsp ground cinnamon</li>
<li>1 tsp ground coriander</li>
<li>1 tsp ground cumin</li>
<li>salt&nbsp;</li>
<li>pepper</li>
</ul>
<div>
<b><br /></b></div>
<div>
<b>Zucchini Sauce:</b></div>
<div>
<ul>
<li>3 medium zucchini, chopped</li>
<li>6 cloves garlic, minced</li>
<li>1/3 cup olive oil</li>
<li>28 oz diced canned tomatoes</li>
<li>red pepper flakes, to taste</li>
<li>2 tbsp parsley, freshly chopped</li>
<li>2 tbsp mint, freshly chopped</li>
<li>1 tbsp balsamic vinegar</li>
<li>salt</li>
<li>pepper</li>
</ul>
<div>
<b>Instructions:</b></div>
<div>
1. Combine all the kofta ingredients in a bowl, and knead for a few minutes until the meat clears the sides of the bowl and the ingredients are evenly distributed.</div>
<div>
<br /></div>
<div>
2. Roll the meat into 8 finger shaped Kofta (I take some liberties on the shapes and numbers here), Dipping your fingers in water will help keep the meat from sticking.&nbsp; Cover and refrigerate for at least 30 minutes for flavors to mellow.</div>
<div>
<br /></div>
<div>
3. While kofta are refrigerating, complete prep for zucchini sauce.</div>
<div>
<br /></div>
<div>
4. Fry zucchini and garlic in the olive oil until slightly browned.&nbsp; Add the rest of the sauce ingredients and simmer uncovered for 10 minutes. ( I recommend completing steps 4 and 5 pretty much simultaneously if you can manage it)</div>
<div>
<br /></div>
<div>
5. After kofta have been refrigerated for at least 30 minutes, grill over medium high heat until cooked through (I brown them in my cast iron over medium-high heat and then cover the pan to let them cook through, rotating occasionally)&nbsp;</div>
<div>
<br /></div>
<div>
6. Serve with rice and/or flatbread.</div>
