Hello Happy Bakers!&nbsp; I'm branching out with this post but in the interest of trying different things I've been doing some experimentation lately with something near and dear to the family: gluten free baking!<br />
<br />
Baking is one of those things that being gluten-free can make difficult, but instead I like to think it's an opportunity for creativity and adventure. It allows you to explore the world of baking that is already gluten free (macarons, pavlovas, and mousse), those recipes that are easier to make gluten free (lemon bars, carrot cake, and choux pastry), and those recipes that it requires a little more creativity (flaky pie crust, puff pastry, and biscuits).<br />
<br />
I of course defer to the resident gluten free expert (WHO I WOULD LOVE TO HAVE GUEST STAR IN THIS POST) about any additional insights she has and would be willing to correct me on!<br />

<b>Science Time</b><br />
What this comes down to in many ways is what gluten does when you bake.&nbsp; Gluten in baked good plays a critical role in the structure of your pastry.&nbsp; When you have a lot of gluten development you have a rigid structure that results in chewier final products (think a french baguette).&nbsp; When you inhibit or weaken gluten development, your final product is lighter and more tender (think chiffon cake).&nbsp; Gluten development can be promoted through some mixing methods (kneading dough) or inhibited by others (cutting flour with fat before adding water).<br />

<br />
Other things that play a role in gluten development include the presence of:<br />
<br />
<ul>
<li>water (gluten will not form until the proteins in flour absorb water; however, a high quantity of water will weaken gluten structures)&nbsp;</li>
<li>fat like butter and eggs (they bind with the proteins in flour to prevent/limit water absorption and thus gluten development)</li>
<li>sugar (sugar also absorbs water which limits the amount available to the flour proteins to form gluten)</li>
<li>salt (strengthens gluten strands to allow longer and more elastic strands to be built)</li>
</ul>
<br />
<b>Why does the science affect gluten free baking?</b><br />
A lot of the differences between those recipes that are easier to make gluten free and those that are tougher relates to the role of gluten in the making of the dessert.&nbsp; For desserts like lemon bars (specifically the crust), you do not want to extensively develop gluten in order to keep your dessert tender, which is why the lack of gluten in gluten-free flour does not impact your final product.&nbsp; However with desserts like flaky pie crust (pate brisee), you want JUST the right amount of gluten to develop, and thus using a gluten free flour may have a greater effect on your final product.<br />
<br />
<b>I still don't get why I should care.&nbsp;</b><br />
Basically what I'm trying to say is, I want to experiment YOU THOUGHT YOU COULD ESCAPE SCIENCE BUT YOU CAN'T! THERE IS A REASON ITS CALLED CULINARY SCIENCE YOU DUMMY!<br />

ahem.<br />
<br />
Anyways, as I was saying I think it would be interesting, educational, and tasty (duh) to try and figure out how gluten free options work as substitutes for different types of recipes.&nbsp; My theory (which at this point is kind of stating the obvious) is for those recipes where you want to weaken gluten development, it will be really easy to substitute gluten free options and have a dessert that is exactly like your gluten dish. Conversely, those desserts and baked goods that require at least some level of gluten development will be harder to pinpoint an exact substitute to replace the lost gluten.<br />
<br />
Obviously a lot of work has been done on this through the marketing and commercialization of products like xanthan gum to stabilize and replace the structure you lose by removing gluten. But I still think it'll be interesting to test out different flour substitutes as well as dessert options to see which ones are easily converted to gluten free and which take a little more creativity (did you catch that sick rhyme?)<br />

<br />
I'll hopefully be posting recipes, updates, and lessons learned as I go, but below is a quick highlight list (for my own reference mostly) of some of the things I want to try--stay tuned, and happy eating!<br />
<br />
<br />
-CFC Lemon Bars<br />
-CFC Choux Pastry<br />
-CFC Pate Sucree<br />
-CFC Chocolate Cake (see older blog post)<br />
-CFC Shortbread Cookies<br />
-RW Carrot Cake (https://www.bonappetit.com/recipe/gluten-free-carrot-cake)<br />
-RW Pate Brisee<br />
-RW Biscuits<br />
-NGF Pavlova<br />
-NGF Curd<br />
-NGF Creme Patisserie<br />
<br />
CFC = Cup for Cup, meaning all I want to change is the flour from regular to a cup for cup substitute<br />
RW = Reworked, meaning the recipe has been more widely changed to address the lack of gluten<br />
NGF= Naturally Gluten Free<br />
