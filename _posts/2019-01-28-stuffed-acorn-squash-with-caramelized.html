<b>Directions</b><br />
<br />
<div class="MsoNormal">
1. Preheat your oven to 400 degrees and line a baking sheet
with parchment paper.</div>

<br /></div>
<div class="MsoNormal">
2. Place the 4 acorn squash halves (seeds removed) cut-side down
on the baking sheet and roast in the preheated oven for about 20-30 minutes, or
until the top of your squash feels tender when gently pressed. You can always
check them and continue to roast a few more minutes if they aren't tender
enough. Set aside after removing from oven.</div>

3. While the squash roasts, make the filling. Begin by
caramelizing the onions (this process takes a good 20-25 minutes to really
bring the flavor out!) In a medium skillet, heat the ghee or coconut oil over low
heat and add all the onions, stirring to coat. Sprinkle with a bit of salt and
cook over low heat, stirring every 5 minutes ago to prevent burning. Once
onions have been cooking for about 25 minutes and are deep golden brown, remove
from heat and set aside.</div>

<div class="MsoNormal">
4. While the squash roasts and the onions cook, heat a large
saucepan over medium low heat and add the remaining 2 tsp cooking fat to melt.
Add the garlic and cook until just tender, then add all the sausage and
increase the heat to medium.<o:p></o:p></div>
<div class="MsoNormal">
<br /></div>
<div class="MsoNormal">
5. Cook the sausage and stir to break up lumps, about 5-8
minutes until just browned. Add the apples and herbs and continue to cook,
stirring until the apples soften. Add the spinach and a pinch of salt and
pepper and cook, stirring, until the spinach wilts. Add the caramelized onions to the sausage mixture, leaving
excess cooking fat in the pan.&nbsp;</div>

<br /></div>
<div class="MsoNormal">
6. Preheat your broiler, then fill all 4 halves of
the squash with the stuffing mixture (you may have leftover depending on how
big your squash was). Arrange the squash on the baking sheet, stuffing side up, and
put under the broiler for 5-10 minutes until the tops get nice and toasty,
checking often to prevent burning. Once nice and browned, remove from oven,
allow to cool a bit and then serve warm. Enjoy!</div>
