I'm finally doing a recipe on arepas :) I don't make them often, but when I do, I remember how much I love these tasty sandwich-esque creations.&nbsp; Arepas are incredibly versatile and have variations common to many different countries in Central or South America.&nbsp; They can also be cooked a multitude of ways--some call to be fried, baked, or even grilled. My favorite is to start them on the stove in a cast iron and then finish them in the oven to cook all the way through. Arepas can be made plain, stuffed with cheese, or split to be filled with pork or chicken or some other filling.<br />

The recipe below can be modified for any of these purposes, although my favorite way to eat them is split and then filled like a sandwich. I'll include a couple links to different arepa recipes that I used in building my own that's below, and I'll do a few posts about different ways you can fill your arepas as well--happy eating!<br />

<b>Ingredients</b><br />
<br />
<div class="MsoNormal">
1 1/2 cups masarepa <i>(likely found in your international food aisle, not to be confused with masa harina) sometimes just called arepa flour</i><o:p></o:p></div>
<div class="MsoNormal">
1 1/2 cups water, plus more as necessary<o:p></o:p></div>
<div class="MsoNormal">
1 teaspoon vegetable oil<o:p></o:p></div>
<div class="MsoNormal">
Kosher salt<o:p></o:p></div>
<div class="MsoNormal">
2 teaspoons butter<o:p></o:p></div>
<div class="MsoNormal">
<br /></div>

<o:p><b>Directions</b></o:p></div>
<div class="MsoNormal">
1. Adjust oven rack to middle position and preheat oven to
325Â°F. Combine masarepa, cheese (if using), 1 cup water, and 1 teaspoon
vegetable oil in a medium bowl and knead with hands until a dough is formed.
Take a small amount and flatten it between your palms If the edges crack, knead
in more water a tablespoon at a time until dough is supple and smooth but not
sticky. Season dough to taste with salt, then cover and set aside for five
minutes.<o:p></o:p></div>
<div class="MsoNormal">
<br /></div>
<div class="MsoNormal">
2. Divide dough into four even pieces and roll into balls.
Working on a wooden cutting board or a regular cutting board with a sheet of
plastic wrap or parchment paper on top of it, flatten each ball down to a disk
about 4-inches in diameter and 1/2-inch thick.<o:p></o:p></div>
<div class="MsoNormal">
<br /></div>
<div class="MsoNormal">
3. Melt butter in a 12-inch cast iron or non-stick skillet over
medium-low heat (see note #3 above). Add arepas and cook, moving them around
the pan and rotating them occasionally, until first side is charred in spots
and a dry crust has formed, about five minutes. Flip arepas and cook on second
side until a dry crust has formed, about five minutes longer.&nbsp;</div>

from oven, let rest 5 minutes, split, fill, and serve.</div>
