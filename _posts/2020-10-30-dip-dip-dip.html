I made this dip on the fly one night! We had pumpkin carving the next day and I expected a variety of light appetizers from other people, but I wanted to provide something with some substance! Some protein! So I lightly followed a few recipes and ended up with a chicken, bean and cheese dip that was delightful! I didn't have rotisserie or precooked chicken around so I seared some chicken breasts and gently shredded them in the food processor.<div><br /></div><div>Ingredients:</div><div>2 cans cannellini beans (drained)</div><div>1/2 yellow onion, diced</div><div>3 cloves garlic, smashed</div><div>juice of one lime</div><div>1 tsp cumin</div><div>1/2 c. sour cream</div><div>1/2 c. greek yogurt</div><div>2 c. shredded chicken</div><div>1/2 c. assorted bell pepper (I used red and green)</div><div>2 Tbsp. chopped cilantro</div><div>1/2 c. + 1/4 c.&nbsp; salsa verde</div><div>2 c. shredded cheese (I used mexican and cheddar)</div><div>1/4 c. chopped pickled jalapenos&nbsp;</div><div><br /></div><div>Directions:</div><div><br /></div><div>Spray a medium baking dish with PAM or other non-stick spray. In a food processor add 1 drained can of beans, half the diced onion, garlic cloves, lime juice, cumin and 1/2 tsp salt. Process until finely mixed and beans are mostly pureed. Remove into large bowl. Add all remaining ingredients to bowl, withholding one cup of cheese and last 1/4 c. salsa verde. Mix to combine. Taste and adjust seasoning. Add more salt, black pepper, lime juice, chopped jalapenos, sour cream, whatever! Make it as you like it! Spicy, cheesy, gooey, loose, seriously whatever. This would be great added to corn tortillas and fried on the stove. Stuff it in enchiladas! OR turn into prepared baking dish and top with remainder 1 cup cheese and last 1/4 c. salsa verde. Bake at 350 until bubbly. Broil, keeping a close eye until cheese turns brown. Eat immediately or cool and reheat in the oven or microwave.&nbsp;&nbsp;</div><div><br /></div><div>Goes great with tortilla chips!&nbsp;</div><div><br /></div><div>Until next time,</div><div>Happy eating!</div>
