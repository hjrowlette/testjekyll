<p>1 pkg of 2 pork tenderloins</p><p>Spice Mix - paprika, garlic powder, oregano, pepper</p><p>Sauce - apple cider vinegar (1/3c), honey (3 T.), soy sauce (3 T.), garlic cloves minced (2-3). (Can add 1/4 c. chicken broth).</p><p>Directions:</p><p>Pat pork dry, sprinkle with salt and spice mix. Sear in pan until well browned. Add in 1 thinly sliced onion. You can remove the pork if you want, or leave it in while the onions cook. If you remove the pork, once the onions are cooked add sauce. Cook in oven (375) until pork temps at 160. Let rest. Sauce can be cooked down on stove top to thicken, or add corn starch slurry.</p><p>Side: Roasted red potatoes (oil, salt, pepper, rosemary, one clove garlic grated) Start at 400 before you begin browning pork. Lower oven temp when you put the pork in. Can continue to cook while pork rests and the sauce thickens.&nbsp;</p>
