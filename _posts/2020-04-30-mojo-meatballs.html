These are trying times and finding ingredients at the store can be really hit or miss. Fortunately this recipe uses a lot of pantry and dry good staples that are almost always around my house or easy to get. Ground pork keeps well in the freezer so snatch up a pound or two next time you hit the store and give these a try when your fridge is looking empty. They're just as easy as our beloved Piri Piri, but with a brighter kick....and maybe a little less garlic breath after the dishes are done. Try them and let me know!<div>

<div>
<br /></div>
<div>
Ingredients:</div>
<div>
<br /></div>
<div>
1 cup packed cilantro sprigs, divided, plus more for serving</div>
<div>
1 large egg</div>
<div>
2/3 c. panko (GF optional)</div>
<div>
1 tsp. ground cumin</div>
<div>
2 Tbsp. plus 1/3 c. EVOO, divided</div>
<div>
4 tsp. sugar, divided</div>
<div>
1 1/2 tsp. Morton kosher salt</div>
<div>
4 garlic cloves, divided</div>
<div>
2 Serrano chilies, or jalapenos, divided</div>
<div>
1 lb. ground pork</div>
<div>
2 medium red onion, cut into 1" wedges</div>
<div>
Black Pepper</div>
<div>
Juice of 1 orange</div>
<div>
Juice of 2 limes</div>
<div>
<br /></div>
<div>
Cooked rice for serving</div>
<div>
<br /></div>
<div>
Directions:</div>
<div>
Place a rack in lower third of oven; preheat to 500. Set aside 1/2 c. cilantro for making the sauce; finely chop remaining 1/2 c. cilantro. Lightly beat egg in a medium bowl to blend. Add panko, cumin, 1 Tbsp. oil, 2 tsp. sugar, and salt, Stir until panko softens and turns pasty.</div>
<div>
*Britt Note: My panko didn't get soft so I added a 1/3 c. water to help loosen it up, it could have been the GF panko so try it without but definitely add if needed* Finely grate 3 garlic cloves and 1 chile into mixture, add chopped cilantro and mix well to combines. Using your hands, mix in pork until even distributed without over mixing.</div>
<div>
<br /></div>
<div>
Toss onions with 1 T. oil in a large rimmed baking sheet; season with salt and pepper. Roast until wedges are well charred underneath, about 10 minutes.</div>
<div>
<br /></div>
<div>
While onions are cooking, divide pork mixture into eight pieces and roll each into a 2"- diameter ball.</div>
<div>
<br /></div>
<div>
Using a metal spatula, turn onions wedges over and scoot towards the edges of the bkaing sheet to make room for meatballs. Arrange meatballs in the center, spacing out evenly. Return baking sheet oto oven and roast until meatballs are browned and spring back when gently pressed and onions are well charred on other side, about 10 minutes.</div>
<div>
<br /></div>
<div>
Meanwhile, removed stem from remaining chile and split in half lengthwise. Place in blender and add OJ, lime juice, reserved 1/2 c. cilantro, remaining garlic clove, 1/3 c. oil, 2 tsp. sugar, and 1 tsp salt. Blend until mostly smooth but still speckled with herbs. Transfer to small bowl for serving.</div>
<div>
<br /></div>
<div>
Eat with rice, extra cilantro, a dash of hot sauce. Crazy yummy and easy and fast to make!</div>
<div>
<br /></div>
<div>
Until next time,&nbsp;</div>
<div>
Happy Eating!</div>
