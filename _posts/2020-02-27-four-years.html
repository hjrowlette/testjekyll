Just a quick note, I'm about a month late but I think it's worth noting this little blog bus is officially 4 years old!<br />
<br />
Can you even believe that? We have definitely had our dry spells without recipes, but I seriously love this blog and sharing recipes with you all, and just wanted to wish us a happy birthday!<br />
<br />
I also want to wave a quick hello to our newest collaborator and author, Hunter!! I wanted to spread the love and give more of us a chance to post recipes because hey, this is a family affair!<br />
