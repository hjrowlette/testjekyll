The good ol' day of pizza Fridays have now been surpassed by nacho Fridays in our condo. I'm always down for nachos! This isn't so much a recipe as a field guide to constructing the perfect plate of crunchy, cheesy, spicy goodness.<br />
<a name='more'></a><br />
<br />
There are several key factors to making a good plate of nachos. The first being you don't use a plate. I use a cookie sheet. The whole goal is to pull everything together in it's peak form. You want crunchy chips, melted cheese, warm toppings and no soggy bottoms! <br />
<br />

When making nachos the first thing I do is dice a yellow (or red) onion and a green pepper. I will typically only use half an onion and the whole pepper. Toss with olive oil, salt and pepper and lay on a cookie sheet. Roast in&nbsp;a 400 degree&nbsp;oven until they are just starting to brown. About 12-15 minutes. Meanwhile, drain a can of corn and a can of black beans.<br />
<br />
<br />
Once the veggies have some color add half each of the corn and beans. Mix gently to get some oil and seasonings on the mix. Bake until the beans are just starting to split their skins and everything is warm, about 10 min.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Avengers, assemble! Wait...wrong group. Nachos, go!&nbsp; Now that the veggie mix is roasted we can start to layer everything. On a small cookie sheet place a single layer of tortilla chips. Trust me, you won't need as many as you think you do. Place in a 350 degree oven until warm and they start to release their oil (you'll know they are&nbsp;ready by the smell). Add whatever kind of cheese you have around, mozzarella and cheddar are my favorites. Place back in the oven until the cheese melts. <br />
<br />
Remove from oven and add your veggie mix, top with chunks of pre-cooked chicken (I use leftover thighs) and pop back in the oven. Once warmed through take back out and&nbsp;add more cheese and jalapeno's if desired. One more time back in the oven and your masterpiece is complete! <br />
<br />
Add the last few toppings like cilantro and green onion once the baking is complete. I love taking an avocado and making a crema with it. Smash a whole avocado until smooth, add a couple tablespoons of yogurt or sour cream and a pinch of salt. Dollop all over the nachos. I typically serve salsa on the side. <br />
<br />
There ya go! A nacho masterpiece, but as with everything I cook take it and make it your own! Substitute&nbsp;leftover taco meat instead of chicken, try pico de gallo, add liberal amounts of siracha.&nbsp;Go crazy!<br />
