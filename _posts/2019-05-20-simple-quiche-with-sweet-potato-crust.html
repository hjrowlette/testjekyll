This was such a welcome addition to my weekend breakfast repertoire. I never would have thought to try sweet potato as a 'crust' base. I'm so glad I gave it a shot. I did switch up the fillings a little bit, but since the entire thing has been eaten I would say it was a hit! Add a cup of coffee and some fresh fruit and you're ready to tackle the weekend.<br />

<br />
Ingredients:<br />
<br />
5 Tbsp. EVOO<br />
1 1/2 lbs. sweet potatoes, peeled, cut unto 1/2- inch or smaller pieces<br />
Kosher salt<br />
1 large onion, thinly sliced<br />
1 small bunch curly kale, stems removed, torn into bite-size pieces<br />
12 large eggs<br />
4 oz. sharp cheddar cheese, grated (about 1 cup)<br />
1 cup whole-milk greek yogurt<br />
Black Pepper<br />
<br />
Directions:<br />
<br />
Heat 2 Tbsp. oil in a large nonstick skillet over medium. Add potatoes, season with salt, and cook, tossing occasionally, until well browned around the edges and just slightly undercooked, 10-12 minutes. Transfer potatoes to a springform pan and let cool; reserve skillet. <br />
<br />
Lightly coat sides of pan with oil. Flatten potatoes slightly with the back of a spoon, packing into the seams where 2 parts of springform pan meet.<br />
<br />
Preheat oven to 300. Heat remaining 2 Tbsp. oil in skillet over medium. Cook onion, tossing occasionally, until softened but not browned, 8-10 minutes. Add kale a handful at a time and cook, stirring, until just softened but not limp, 5-6 minutes. Season with salt. Let cool slightly. <br />
<br />
Whisk eggs, cheese, and yogurt in a large bowl; season with salt and pepper. Set springform pan on a parchment or foil-lined rimmed baking sheet. Top potatoes with half of kale and onions, then pour in egg mixture. Gently press remaining kale and onions into surface of egg mixture.<br />
<br />
Bake quiche until edges have puffed up slightly and top is just set with no liquid egg remaining, 55-75 minutes. Let cool before slicing. <br />
<br />
My notes:<br />
The potatoes were harder to smash then I excepted. They were also a little too oily. I ended up using my hands and the potatoes were only at the bottom of the pan. They didn't come up the sides like a true quiche crust would. I was originally concerned about the egg mix leaking out, so I wrapped the bottom of the pan in foil and didn't have any issues. <br />
<br />
For the changes to the filling,&nbsp;I didn't use kale (only because I didn't have any). I substituted spinach and mushrooms. I made sure to cook off about the same amount of liquid recommended that they did for the kale to make sure that the quiche wouldn't be watery. I loved putting half of the veggie mix in, pouring the egg on, and then patting the remainder of the filling on top. It really helped make the veggie load even.<br />
<br />
For the egg mix, I didn't use all twelve eggs because I was only feeding three people and I didn't want there to be too much. But I didn't cut back on the yogurt or cheese. The egg mixture was so good! The full fat yogurt really made it creamy and delicious. It really took the full 75 minutes to bake though so patience is required. It was so worth it! Next time I will do a few more veggies and add a combination of different types of cheese.<br />
<br />
Until next time,<br />
Happy eating! <br />
