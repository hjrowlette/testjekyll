<br />
Even when it's a roasting 95 degrees down here in the sunshine state, when the equinox rolls around I get a craving for all things fall! I found this wonderful recipe for a season appropriate roasted chicken that is full of seasonal veggies (and fruit). I did make a few changes from the original recipe, but I enjoyed it all the more! I'll include my additions on this post, and the link to the original recipe.<br />

<br />
<strong>INGREDIENTS:</strong><br />
<br />
1/2 c. Walnuts<br />
2 T.&nbsp; Honey<br />
8 oz. Goat Cheese<br />
2 T. Fresh sage, chopped <br />
7-8 Whole&nbsp;sage leaves<br />
2 Tsp. rosemary (I used dried)<br />
2 T. Olive Oil<br />
Salt and Pepper to taste<br />
1 Whole Chicken (4-5 lbs)<br />
1 Whole head of garlic, sliced in half (keep any cloves that fall loose)<br />
2 Green Apples, quartered<br />
~1lb Red grapes*, wash and removed from stems<br />
1 Onion, quartered<br />
5-6 Red potatoes, quartered<br />
<br />
*See Notes<br />
<br />
<br />
<strong>DIRECTIONS:</strong><br />
<br />
Preheat oven to 375<br />
<br />
Using a small skillet over medium heat, combine the walnuts and honey and cook until toasted and slightly caramelized. Remove and lay out in a single layer to cool. Roughly chop walnuts*.<br />
<br />
Mix together softened goat cheese, walnuts, chopped sage, and rosemary. <br />
<br />
In a roasting pan combine the potatoes, half the onion, one apple, grapes,&nbsp;whole sage,&nbsp;and any loose garlic cloves. Sprinkle with olive oil, salt and pepper to taste. Toss to combine. After removing giblets, set whole chicken in pan on top of assorted veggies. Stuff chicken with remaining onion, apple and halved garlic*. Whatever you cannot fit into the chicken can be tossed into roasting pan.<br />
<br />
Carefully separate skin from the chicken without ripping,&nbsp;and stuff the goat cheese mixture in. Really work the mixture as far down into the chicken as you can, including the legs. Try to spread it out, the goat cheese&nbsp;gets dry after roasting and an even distribution all over tastes&nbsp;better than large pockets just on the breasts. &nbsp;If you don't use all the mix you can sprinkle the remainder on top of the veggie mix in the pan*.<br />
<br />
Salt and pepper the chicken, and drizzle lightly with olive oil. Rub to coat all the chicken, don't forget the wings and legs! Tuck wing tips under the chicken and tie the legs with kitchen string. .<br />
<br />
Roast chicken for an hour, check to make sure it isn't browning too quickly. If it is cover with foil, and continue cooking until juices run clear, about an hour more. <br />
<br />
Allow to set 10 minutes before carving. Can be served with drippings from pan made with apple cider and chicken broth gravy. Enjoy!<br />
<br />
Some notes:<br />
*The grapes are delicious but the apples and potatoes are the real winner. You can use more grapes (or just grapes and apples) but I enjoyed them as an addition, not the main feature. <br />
*Chop however large you like walnuts to be, I wanted a combination of medium and fine pieces <br />
* Loose garlic cloves were super yummy, pop some out if you want to add to the veggie mix<br />
*While the extra goat cheese in the pan is good, it does get dry so try to get it all in the chicken! If you're using a smaller chicken, use less than 8oz of goat cheese.<br />
