Another day, another recipe that cements my deep love for chicken thighs :) this recipe is crazy flavorful, really fast to pull together, and a great weeknight dinner in my opinion!&nbsp; it does call for 30 minutes to 2 hours of marinating, but I could totally see these marinating overnight so that all you have to do is pop them in the oven :)<br />
<br />

The first note I have is about fish sauce--I have a very iffy relationship with this ingredient, and when I saw how much it called for I had some deep misgivings because its a very...ahem...fragrant...ingredient HOWEVER, despite my misgivings it adds a great dimension to this marinade and I wouldn't change it at all. so if you're like me and find the smell a little offputting, have a little faith that it'll be okay because i promise it ends up so good<br />
<br />
The second note I have is about the seasoning--you'll notice there is NO salt or pepper called for in this recipe. *mind explosion* while I can see where pepper would add a nice touch to the marinade, I would really not add any additional salt.&nbsp; you get a lot of sodium in the chicken from the soy sauce, and I think anything extra would be a little too much<br />
<br />
that's all I've got, happy eating!<br />

<span style="font-size: large;"><b>Vietnamese Chicken Thighs</b></span><br />
<b><br /></b>
<b>Ingredients</b><br />
2 lb bone-in, skin-on chicken thighs<br />
1/4 cup soy sauce<br />
1/4 cup fish sauce<br />
1/4 cup palm or dark brown sugar<br />
1 tbsp minced and peeled fresh ginger<br />
2 tsp hot chili-garlic paste (sambal oelek)<br />
1 1/2 tbsp fresh lime juice (1 lime)<br />
1 tsp lime zest (1 lime)<br />
3 medium cloves of garlic, minced or grated<br />
2 packed tbsp fresh cilantro, finely chopped<br />
2 tbsp grapeseed or neutral oil (I used canola)<br />
sliced limes and cilantro leaves for garnish<br />
<br />
<b>Directions</b><br />
1. Place thighs in large ziploc bag.&nbsp; In a medium bowl, whisk together all other ingredients. Pour marinade into bag with chicken, seal, and toss to coat. Let marinate at least 30 minutes or up to 4 hours.<br />
<br />
2. Preheat oven to 425 degrees.&nbsp; Line a rimmed baking sheet with foil. Remove chicken from bag, allowing marinade to drip off, and set on foil skin side up, giving plenty of space between each thigh.<br />
<br />
3. Bake until thighs register 155 to 160 degrees, about 35 minutes. If chicken skin is not brown and crisp enough by the time the thighs are fully cooked, broil for about a minute until it is browned and crisped. Transfer to serving platter and let rest for 5 minutes, garnish with lime slices and cilantro, and serve.<br />
