Pounding out the meat isn't that bad, use the flat side of a meat tenderizer or the bottom of a pan. I try to roll the pork so it ends up even on both ends and in the middle, so I'm not married to rolling it length or width ways, I just want it to cook evenly. Be sure to salt and pepper all sides of the meat before and after you stuff it. We grill with charcoal (we're not heathens), we placed the charcoal in the baskets and set up the grill for indirect heat. We started with 4 minutes and rotated to all four sides as best we could. Basting in between. I think it took a total of 35 minutes on the grill, and we let it rest in a warm oven to make sure it was cooked through. A meat thermometer is absolutely required to make sure the middle isn't raw! If the outside is getting too cooked or burnt and the middle needs more time, place in a 350 oven and check temp every 5-7 minutes. There's nothing wrong with starting on the grill and finishing in the oven. I quite like this method! Especially for very thick or stuffed meat. Be sure to let rest when finished before carving.</p><p>Until next time, happy eating!</p>
