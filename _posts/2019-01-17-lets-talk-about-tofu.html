Ah tofu. A cooks best friend and worst nightmare all in one little liquid filled package. Cook it wrong and you might as well eat soggy cardboard. Cook it right? A world of possibilities await!&nbsp;It's cheap, protein filled vegetarian goodness that I don't know how&nbsp;I've been living without.&nbsp;This recipe came from my dear, dear friend. Bon Appetit. I love them, I would quit my job and move across the country for an opportunity to work in their kitchens! But for now, onto the tofu!<br />

There is silken, regular (soft), firm, extra firm, seasoned, smoked, okay you get it. I always get extra firm because I'm usually adding into a recipe where I need it to keep its body. Silken and soft tofu&nbsp;can actually be added to pie!&nbsp;The second lesson, prep your tofu ahead of time.&nbsp;Woe unto the&nbsp;home cook&nbsp;that&nbsp;waits till the evening of and does a poor job of wringing all that extra moisture out.&nbsp;Pressing and salting your tofu ahead of time is a must. There's no short cut for time.<br />
<br />
I always prep my tofu the same way and then tackle the recipe. So here's how I prep:<br />
<br />
Open your tofu and drain the liquid out of it. Remove the block of tofu and cut long ways into 3 or 4 sections skinny-ish flats. Like the image.&nbsp;I then do an initial press with paper towels. Once the&nbsp;bulk of the liquid has been pressed out I layer paper towels on a dinner plate and lay the four flats of tofu onto it. Now salt. Liberally. Don't be scared of salt, but whatever you do, <u><strong>don't use table salt!</strong></u> It is much too fine and salty for this kind of prep. I recommended a good kosher salt, it's got big flakes that dissolve easily into your food and its not as salty so if you go overboard it's much more forgiving. But I could&nbsp;talk about salt all day, back to the&nbsp;tofu! Salt on both sides and lay more paper towels on top, put another dinner plate to sandwich all the tofu and paper towels together. Place something heavy on top, OJ, milk, your youngest child (looking at you Maddy) and let set in the fridge overnight. In a pinch the morning of would work. The next evening throw out the paper towels and you're ready to cook!<br />

So now my favorite tofu recipes. I've had a lot of luck with pan frying tofu for both pad thai and this recipe that follows. I haven't yet explored the world of fried or baked tofu (though I think Hannah has). I would imagine a non stick pan would work, but I don't think you would get the same level of crispness that you do in a Dutch oven. That being said, I did try to pan fry my latest batch in my stainless steel pan...utter disaster. The tofu stuck horribly and all the crispy goodness stayed in the pan when I finally managed to wrench it off before it began to burn. Thankfully, tofu is forgiving! I placed the semi-fried sad looking tofu onto paper towels to drain away most of the oil and started over. I returned to my faithful Dutch oven which has never, ever failed me and heated more oil and fried the tofu a second time. It crisped up no problem! Don't be afraid to just let it go, it will get much crispier than you would think, its pretty incredible. If salted properly you can actually eat it straight out the pan, it's very yummy! It's got a crunch you wouldn't think to see in a protein short of fried chicken.<br />
<br />
And now finally, after all this, you're ready for my new favorite tofu recipe from BA. It's got ginger, soy sauce and...maple syrup!&nbsp;It's everything&nbsp;you could ever need for the tofu dinner of your dreams.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<strong><span style="font-size: large;">Crispy Tofu with Maple-Soy Glaze</span></strong><br />
<br />
Ingredients:<br />
12 oz block firm tofu ( I use extra firm)<br />
1/4 c. low sodium soy sauce<br />
3 Tbsp. pure maple syrup (No Mrs. Butterworth here!)<br />
3 Tbsp. unseasoned rice vinegar<br />
1/2 tsp. crushed red pepper flakes<br />
1/2" Piece of ginger peeled, and very thinly sliced<br />
1/2 c. neutral oil<br />
Topping options include: kimchi, toasted sesame seeds, sliced scallions, steamed rice<br />
<br />
Directions:<br />
Drain tofu, then sandwich between several layers of kitchen towels to remove excess liquid. Cut into 9 cubes. (I would recommend following my preparation instructions above!)<br />
<br />
Whisk soy sauce, maple syrup, rice vinegar, red pepper flakes, and ginger in a small bowl. <br />
<br />
Heat oil in a large nonstick skillet (Dutch oven is better) over medium-high heat. When oil is rippling across the surface, carefully add tofu so it doesn't splash. Cook, undisturbed, until very crisp and dark brown underneath, 3-4 minutes (or longer!). Carefully turn and repeat on opposite side. Holding tofu back with slotted spoon or spatula, pour out oil into a small bowl. Return skillet to medium-high heat and add soy sauce mixture. Cook, reducing heat to medium so it doesn't over-reduce or burn and basting tofu occasionally, until glaze is thick enough to coat a spoon, about 4 minutes. <br />
<br />
Divide, drizzle with glaze and top with scallions. Serve with rice.<br />
<br />
And there ya have it! Until next time, happy eating!<br />

EXTRA EXTRA:<br />
Tofu update! I have tried something new and loved it! I prepped the tofu as described above and created something new. The tofu taco tater. A way back Wednesday hit from our childhood of the regular taco tater and replaced it with tofu! I cooked the tofu in a nonstick pan with some olive oil and seasoned it like I would hamburger. I can't use taco seasoning packs since they typically&nbsp;have flour so I use a combo of: chili powder, cumin, salt, pepper, onion powder, garlic powder, and cayenne. I also added a little bit of diced onion and garlic once the tofu got some color. To really bring it all together I added a little bit of water after it was almost done and let it all cook down a bit to help the flavors meld. Such a great swap, if you didn't know it wasn't hamburger you would think it was chicken or turkey. <br />
