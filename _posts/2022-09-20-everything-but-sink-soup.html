<p>&nbsp;This is a riff off a great family classic--lentil soup! It has a lot of the same elements, but I've just gotten in the habit of throwing in whatever vegetable scraps, meat leftovers, or spices I'm in the mood for! Plus we don't have the original lentil soup on the blog so it's way past time it was added. It's super easy and quick and so easy to make your own. enjoy :)</p><p><br /></p><p><b>Everything but the Sink Soup</b></p><p><b>Ingredients</b></p><p>1 lb lentils (green, french, red), rinsed and drained</p><p>8 cups water or stock (veg, chicken, etc)</p><p>1 large chopped onion</p><p>EVOO</p><p>4-6 minced garlic</p><p>1 lb smoked sausage, coined</p><p>cooked/wilted spinach or kale</p><p>sliced carrots</p><p>can of roasted diced tomatoes</p><p>1 tsp oregano, italian seasoning, or other herbs</p><p>salt and pepper</p><p>miso</p><p>balsamic vinegar</p><p>gochujang</p><p><br /></p><p><b>Directions</b></p><p>1.
