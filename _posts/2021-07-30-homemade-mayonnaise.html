<p>Yup folks you read that right, MAYO. Now listen here and I'll tell you a secret. I don't really like mayonnaise. I'm sorry, I just don't! I was never asked to make sandwiches growing up because I would put a little mayo on and then proceed to scrape off as much as I could, no one liked my sammies. Except me of course. I always thought it had a weird taste and didn't add a lot to a sandwich. The older I've gotten the more I've come to realize that mayo is kind of a workhorse. Yes, it definitely adds some moisture to a sandwich, especially when it comes to dry ass gluten free bread. But it can also give you a perfect golden crust on the outside of a grilled cheese. Or a little something extra when eaten with home made sweet potato fries. Finally I decided that all of the internet hype must be right: homemade mayonnaise would be better. And they were right! It was as Michael called it, "fluffy." It doesn't taste like chemicals and it would be wicked good on so many things! This is my first time attempting a Babish recipe and I'm glad I did, so here you go:</p><p>Ingredients:</p><p>2 whole eggs</p><p>1 tsp. dijon mustard</p><p>2 Tbsp. fresh lemon juice</p><p>1 garlic clove, crushed</p><p>1/2 tsp kosher salt</p><p>2 c. vegetable oil</p><p><br /></p><p>Directions:&nbsp;</p><p>In a high-sided container, combine the eggs, mustard, lemon juice, garlic and salt. Whisk to combine.&nbsp;</p><p>Pour the oil down the side of the container, making sure the oil stays in a single layer above the egg mixture.</p><p>Take an immersion blender and carefully put into the egg mixture at the bottom of the container. With the blender on high speed work the blender up and down, emulsifying the oil into the egg mix from the bottom up.&nbsp; This will happen quickly! Continue to move the blender up and down in the mixture until all of the oil is combined and the mixture becomes thick and homogenous. Store in an airtight container and fridge for up to 2 weeks.&nbsp;</p><p>A few notes: First, the ratio of egg to oil. 1 egg to 1 cup of oil. It is so easy to double or triple this recipe, or half it. You are best suited to making the amount of mayo that you need because the trade off of homemade mayo is that it will not keep as long as store bought stuff. One other thing I noted is that I did a 1.5x, but I only did one clove of garlic. And let me tell you, you could taste it. Now it certainly wasn't a bad thing! Most of my mayo ended up in chicken salad or sandwiches and when blended all together wasn't strong at all. But just be aware if you don't want a strong garlic taste to consider cutting the garlic.&nbsp;</p><p>My thoughts for next time: Mayo &amp; chipotle in adobo? Blend the peppers in adobo sauce in a blender and fold into mayo. Would be so good on a chicken and bacon sandwich! Or smash an avocado or two and mix into mayo. Or thin out with a little extra lemon juice and try with zucchini fries. So many options!</p><p>And just to put this out there, if the idea of eating raw eggs makes you squeamish, fret not let's check the science. Eggs are incredibly sanitized per FDA regulations and the likelihood of salmonella is very minimal. Especially when in regards to this recipe you consider that the eggs are refrigerated up until the mayo is made, and again after the recipe is done. You're more likely to get salmonella from a mayo laden pasta or potato salad that has been sitting out at room temperature for several hours. If this is still a hard pass for you, that's okay too! More for me!&nbsp; &nbsp;</p><p><br /></p><p>Until next time, happy eating!</p><p><br /></p><p>https://basicswithbabish.co/basicsepisodes/picnic-food&nbsp;</p>
