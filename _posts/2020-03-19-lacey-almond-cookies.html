This is another work-in-progress recipe. Brittany challenged me to make a gluten free cookie based on the flavors of a ferrero rocher chocolate, and I'll admit I have thus far failed to come through. However! I did make some progress in the form of this almond cookie. My goal was to partially dip the cookie in chocolate, and then roll it in crushed hazelnuts. But after about four separate attempts I've...taken a sabbatical...from this challenge<br />
<br />
But regardless, the cookie itself is super tasty, really light, and gluten free! It is super neutral and would pair well with fresh berries, whipped cream, or a bit of hot fudge depending on what you have on hand!<br />
