Crème brulee. Wait,&nbsp;isn't that&nbsp;what they serve at fancy restaurants and charge a bunch of money for?&nbsp;&nbsp;It sounds so intimidating, I can't make that! WRONG. Guys this is so stinkin' easy I can't believe I haven't tried it before! I followed Alton Brown's recipe and he hasn't led me astray yet! Give this delicious rich and creamy a desert and try and you'll see just how easy and achievable this really is. <br />

First, my advice. Buy good ingredients! There's not a whole lot that goes into this and using store brand butter and heavy cream is just not worth it. I also splurged for a real vanilla bean. Guess how much it cost me? $11. Yeah, for one. But it was SO worth it! I mean it's the flavor for the whole dessert! Imitation vanilla absolutely will not cut it.&nbsp;That being said I did make a half recipe and thus used only a half a bean. There's more crème brulee in the future for me! Yay!<br />
<br />
My next advice, prep ahead! I decided to make the base of the custard the night before I was serving and it was the right choice. Once it finished I let it cool and wrapped in saran wrap to keep out any nasty fridge flavors. The next night I let it come almost back to room temp so that when I melted the sugar it wouldn't crack my pottery. You really could prep a bunch for a nice dinner and not worry about them until it's dessert time!<br />
<br />
Speaking of pottery! I bought little ramekins that I knew were oven safe, they were 8oz a piece and came in three cute colors! They were less than $2 each at Walmart and I think they were pioneer women. Highly recommend!<br />
<br />
The last bit of advice, to sum it up the broiling of my crème brulee didn't go according to plan. Oh the sugar melted all right, it caramelized and got lots of great color. I watched it like a hawk to make sure my dishes weren't cracking and the sugar wasn't burning. The problem? The custard melted. By the time the sugar had achieved the color I wanted I had failed to take into consideration that the poor little custard base was getting blasted by the heat as well as the sugar. Was it ruined? Absolutely not! It was still delicious! Michael, Hannah and I all agreed that having the firm sugar&nbsp;top was way more important than cool custard. It didn't melt all the way through, and some was still cool but having that hard sugar crack on the top was critical to a well balance dessert. Otherwise it's just like vanilla pudding. The texture of the&nbsp;hardened sugar really seals the deal!<br />
<br />
Okay getting off my advice train and here's the recipe! Don't be afraid to experiment! Custard comes in all kinds of flavors, you're only limited to what you're willing to try. <br />
<br />
(full recipe)<br />
Ingredients.<br />
1 quart heavy cream<br />
1 vanilla bean, split and scraped<br />
1 c. sugar, divided<br />
6 large egg yolks (try keeping those whites for meringue!)<br />
2 quarts hot water<br />
<br />
Directions:<br />
Preheat oven to 325.<br />
Place cream, vanilla bean and it's pulp into a medium saucepan over medium-high heat and bring to a boil. Remove from heat, cover and allow to sit for 15 minutes. Remove bean and save for another use.<br />
In a medium bowl, whisk together 1/2 c. sugar and the egg yolks until well blended and just starts to lighten in color. Add the cream a little at a time, stirring constantly. Pour the liquid into 6 (7-8oz) ramekins. Place ramekins into a large cake or roasting pan. Pour enough hot water into the pan to come halfway up the sides of the dishes. Bake just until the crème brulee is set, but still trembling in the center, 40 to 45 minutes. <br />
Remove from roasting pan and refrigerate for at least 2 hours and up to three days. Remove from the fridge for at least 30 minutes prior to browning the sugar on top. Divide the remaining 1/2 c sugar equally among the 6 dishes and spread evenly on top. Using a torch, melt the sugar and form a crispy top. Allow to set for 5 minutes before serving.<br />
