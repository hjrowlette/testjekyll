The noodles always end up getting soggy and it's just no good. Now that being said, I love chicken and rice soup! I'm basically obsessed with my chicken and wild rice soup and wanted to switch it up a bit. This was such a&nbsp;yummy take on the idea and managed to use a lot of ingredients that I typically have on hand.&nbsp;So now we have Asian&nbsp;style&nbsp;chicken and rice soup:<br />
<a name='more'></a><br />
Ingredients:<br />
2-3&nbsp;boneless skinless&nbsp;chicken thighs<br />
1 diced onion<br />
3 smashed garlic cloves<br />
2 inches of&nbsp;ginger, half roughly&nbsp;chopped (the other half is for topping)<br />
3c. chicken broth (or water)<br />
1/2c.&nbsp;rinsed jasmine rice<br />
1 Tbl. fish sauce (optional)<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Toppings: Green&nbsp;onions, lime juice, cilantro,&nbsp;peanuts, siracha, jalapenos, sweet ginger (see below)<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Directions:<br />

Brown chicken&nbsp;in a Dutch oven for ~4 min on the first side. When you flip to the second side add in the onion and smashed garlic cloves, cook 2-3 min.&nbsp;The goal is to get some&nbsp;color the chicken to help add flavor to the soup. Add chopped ginger and chicken broth, be sure to scrape up all the brown bits from the bottom. Bring to low simmer and cook 10-13 minutes until the chicken is cooked through. Pull the chicken out and set aside to cool. Typically the broth is really chunky from the aromatics, so I like to pulse my emersion blender until everything is smooth. Add in the rinsed jasmine rice, cover and let cook until the rice is done about 20 min. Meanwhile once the chicken is cool enough to handle, shred finely. Taking the time to shred is worth it, the soup just isn't the same with cut chicken. Once the rice is done add the chicken back in and taste and adjust salt and pepper as needed. If desired finish with fish sauce. What makes this soup is the toppings! You can go as crazy or a simple as you like, I always have peanuts, limes, green onion and siracha around so I would start there. The sweet ginger is really great as well. What I love about soup is how you can make it your own, add more or less rice if you want a thicker or thinner soup. Use chicken that's already cooked or try regular white rice. The possibilities are&nbsp;endless! <br />

<br />
Sweet ginger:<br />
Take the remaining 1in of your ginger and cut into slivers. Dissolve 1 tsp of sugar in 2 tablespoons of hot water. Let the ginger soak in the sugar water until the soup is ready. Serve&nbsp;on top.<br />
