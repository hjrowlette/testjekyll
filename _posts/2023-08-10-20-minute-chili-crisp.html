<p>&nbsp;This is a recipe from Britt... A fridge staple which is wonderful to cook your eggs in, or add to cooked greens or a soup, drizzled on avocado toast.&nbsp; This has great flavor, without too much heat, definitely a family fave! Please feel free to edit this Britt, just getting a start to it !&nbsp; We need the website this came from... I cannot remember, perhaps you can add it?</p><p><br /></p><p><b>Ingredients</b></p><p>1 1/2 cups neutral oil ( I use corn)</p><p>2 large shallots, thinly sliced</p><p>8 cloves of garlic, thinly sliced</p><p>1/2 cup Chinese red chili flakes</p><p>2 Tbsp gochugaru (Korean red chili flakes)</p><p>3/4 tsp salt</p><p>1 Tbsp sugar</p><p>1 tsp msg (optional)</p><p>1 Tbsp soy sauce</p><p>1 Tbsp sesame seeds, toasted</p><p>Pour oil into a medium saucepan, add the shallot and garlic.&nbsp; Turn the heat to medium high and continue to stir until shallot and garlic are slightly browned.&nbsp; You will see the oil bubbling, but this can take up to 15- 20 minutes depending on the oil temperature.&nbsp;</p><p>While this is cooking, mix both chili flakes, sugar, salt, and msg in a heat proof container.&nbsp; I use stainless steel as the high temperature can cause glass or porcelain to crack.&nbsp;</p><p>Remove crispy shallots and garlic from oil, set aside. Bring the oil temperature up to 350 degrees.&nbsp; Pour hot oil over chili flake mixture. Stir to combine, then add the soy sauce, toasted sesame seeds, the crispy garlic and shallots.&nbsp; Mix and enjoy.&nbsp; Store this covered in the refrigerator.</p><p>&nbsp;</p>
