In a quick follow up to my previous barbacoa recipe, I'm adding the chuck roast and pinto bean slow cooker recipe to the blog. I've combed the depths of my email for it on more than one occasion and now it's here in its forever home! Long live the slow cooker!<br />

Slow Cooker Beef and Pinto Beans.<br />
<br />
Ingredients:<br />
2 - 3 lb. (or larger) chuck roast<br />
2 c. or 1 lb. dry pinto beans (Do not soak)<br />
1 can rotel or diced tomatoes (add two cans if using a larger roast)<br />
1 - 2 onions diced<br />
6 cloves garlic, smashed<br />
1.5 tsp cumin<br />
2 tsp garlic powder<br />
1 Tbsp. chili powder<br />
1 c. water<br />
<br />
Directions:<br />
<br />
Season chuck roast with salt and pepper on all sides and sear well until a golden crust forms. Rise beans in colander and remove any small stones or grit. Add all other ingredients into the slow cooker and mix well. Place roast on top of bean and tomato mix and add enough water to cover beans and about half of the roast. Cook on high 4 hours or low for 8. Add water as needed to keep beans covered. Roast is done when it shreds easily with a fork and beans are soft through. Remove and shred completely and mix back into cooked beans. Serve with rice or on a tortilla with sour cream and salsa.<br />
<br />
Great the next day for breakfast with a fried egg on top!<br />
