<span style="font-family: &quot;times new roman&quot; , serif; font-size: 12pt;">I believe that this post is the
first of it's kind, it's dedicated entirely to vegetables! I love veggies, I
can't get enough. What most people consider enough veggies to feed a family I
consider enough for me and Michael. It's a problem, but it's the right kind of
problem to have! I read somewhere that if you don't like a vegetable, it's not
being cooked right. So to all those brussel sprout and kale haters out there,
ya crazy! That being said, even I have my limits (looking at you okra and lima
beans). There are a couple of small recipes and theories&nbsp;that I want to highlight. The first
is kale.</span><br />

<span style="font-family: &quot;times new roman&quot; , serif; font-size: 12pt;">Kale. Can. Be. Good. I promise! I
have taken to buying 1lb bags of it and it makes a great dinner,
smoothie,&nbsp;or salad addition. I buy it pre prepped, so all of the large
bitter stems have already been removed. It's washed and ready to rock and roll!
I've&nbsp;been&nbsp;cooking&nbsp;it in my stainless steel pan. I'll get it
really hot and add a healthy dollop of olive oil. Once the oil shimmers add as
much sliced garlic as you (and the pan) can handle. Just before the garlic
starts to brown I'll add several heavy handfuls of kale and let it set. This
lets it get brown on the bottom, depending on how wet the kale is sometimes
this goes better than others... Once it starts to wilt I'll generously season
with salt and pepper give it a good turn and as it cooks down if it's not
enough I'll add another handful. Once it's all wilted finish with some fresh
lemon and crushed red pepper. Yum!<o:p></o:p></span><br />

Broccoli. Our
ever beloved BA gets credit for this idea. The concept is simple, crunchy brown
broccoli paired with lemon, red pepper, and...wait for it...cheddar cheese. I
made this for the first time this weekend and&nbsp;my life&nbsp;is forever
changed! Cut broccoli into bite sized pieces and get either a cast iron or
stainless steel pan real hot. Add a few table spoons of olive oil and once it
shimmers arrange the broccoli into a single layer, cut side down. Season with
salt and pepper. Now here is where I went off the reservation per the BA brain
child. I had a very simple problem. In order to make sure that my broccoli got
crispy I didn't shove all that I had prepped into the pan. Because as everyone
knows, an overcrowded pan don't crisp, it steams! SO. Once my first batch was
brown but still very crisp, I pulled it off and set it on a cookie sheet. I
browned my second batch and preheated my oven to 350. Once all the broccoli was
a little charred and still very crunchy. I crumbled sharp white cheddar all
over and followed behind it with a few heavy shakes of crushed red pepper. I
let it bake for just about 10 min and finished it under the broiler. Once it
came out I finished with lemon juice. O.M.G. Revolutionary! It's like a
healthier, more adult&nbsp;take on broccoli with cheese sauce. </span><br />

<span style="font-family: &quot;times new roman&quot; , serif; font-size: 12pt;">Round 3! Clearly there is a trend in
this post: browned veggies. And this recipe stays true to that concept! By now
we all know and love our oven roasted broccoli. This takes that same concept,
but with brussel sprouts! Wash and prep the sprouts by cutting them in half.
Place in a single layer on a cookie sheet and toss with EVOO, salt and pepper.
Roast at 400 until delightfully brown, about 20 min. While the sprouts are
wrapping up in a small Tupperware container mix equal parts lemon juice, maple
syrup (the real stuff!), and olive oil, salt and pepper. Typically I do a
tablespoon of each. Once the sprouts are done, shake the container until the
mixture is emulsified. Drizzle on the roasted sprouts and enjoy! I've been
using this concept for quite a while and this vinaigrette is really good on any
cruciferous vegetable. I love it on broccoli!<o:p></o:p></span><br />

<span style="font-family: &quot;times new roman&quot; , serif; font-size: 12pt;">The last one. This is a Hannah brain
child, but I think it belongs in this post as it has found a home in my heavy
vegetable rotation. Green beans with shallot and lemon. It's very simple, wash
and cut the beans into bite sized pieces. Roast in a pan on the stove (or heck,
try the oven!), with EVOO, salt and pepper. Once they just start to get soft
add in 2 sliced shallots and cook until they are opaque. I like to try to get
my beans really browned before I add in the shallots. Pull off the heat and
finish with a heavy squeeze of lemon. </span><br />

<span style="font-family: &quot;times new roman&quot; , serif; font-size: 12pt;">There are several trends in all
these posts. Take a veggie, any veggie. Add high heat, plenty of olive oil and
seasoning. Cook until brown, finish with any combo of lemon juice, cheese,
crushed red pepper, or try them all! I haven't found a veggie that it doesn't
work with yet (except you okra, you will never taste good). </span><br />
