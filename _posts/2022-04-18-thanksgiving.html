<p>&nbsp;Turkey-</p><p>Have turkey thawed by Tuesday, on Tuesday night prepare dry rub listed below. Spatchcock the turkey and remove the wishbone. Pat dry and season liberally with the dry rub, you won't use all of what you've made! Make sure to put dry rub under the skin. Line roasting pan with aluminum foil, this makes it easy to discard of the liquid the turkey will release over the next two days. Put prepared turkey on roasting rack and place into pan. Leave uncovered in fridge until Thanksgiving morning.</p><p>Dry Rub Ingredients:</p><p>2T. whole black peppercorn</p><p>2T. whole pink peppercorn</p><p>1/2 c. Diamond Crystal or 1/4c. Morton Kosher salt</p><p>2 T. garlic powder</p><p>2 T. onion powder</p><p>1 T. light brown sugar</p><p>1 T. smoked paprika&nbsp;</p><p>Grate peppercorns very finely in mortar and pestle or with spice mill. Mix with all other ingredients and use on prepared turkey.</p><p>On Thanksgiving morning:</p><p>Pull turkey 1.5 hours before it goes into the oven. Preheat oven to 425 degrees. Remove the foil from the bottom of the pan. Use paper towels to dry bottom of pan. Add one quartered onion, two carrots (halved), two celery stalks (halved), and 1/2 cup of water to bottom of the pan. Drizzle turkey lightly with vegetable oil and put into oven. Let cook for 30 minutes before lowering the temperature to 375. Cook 1.5 hours and begin checking the largest part of the breast for temperature. Pull once breast has hit 160, let rest AT LEAST 30 minutes before carving.</p><p>Turkey Stock:&nbsp;</p><p>Once turkey is dry brined, place turkey spine, giblets and neck onto cookie sheet. Add 2 quartered onions (skin on), 3 stalks of celery cut into thirds, 3 carrots (unpeeled) cut into thirds. Toss everything with a few tablespoons of vegetable oil, salt and pepper. Roast at 450 degrees for 10-15 minutes until everything gets a little color. Place everything on cookie sheet into slow cooker. Add 3 fresh bay leaves, 1 bunch of Italian parsley, several whole black peppercorns, and two boxes of store bought chicken stock. This can be supplemented with any frozen chicken carcasses you might have. Cook on low heat for 12-24 hours (I usually strain mine Wednesday evening). Stock will be very dark. Strain through cheesecloth and fine mesh sieve. Taste and adjust with a few tablespoons of white wine vinegar or salt. **Be very careful about not making your stock too salty! This is the base of your gravy the turkey drippings will be very salty as well!**&nbsp;</p><p>**Can add additional chicken/turkey wings or drums to boost stock flavor**</p><p><br /></p><p>Stuffing:</p><p>On Wednesday night cut a loaf of GF bread into small pieces, toast in low temp oven for 20-30 minutes until very dry. Let cool and place in bowl until Thursday. On day of Thanksgiving, mince 1 onion, 2 carrots and 2 celery stalks. Mix into breadcrumbs and add 1 tsp of poultry seasoning, salt and pepper. Beat two eggs, carefully temper eggs with warm stock. Add into additional stock to make total volume of 2 cups. Slowly add stock to stuffing mix until mixture can hold shape when lightly packed into a ball. Turn into buttered baking dish, bake for 1 hour or until warmed through and browned on top. (I usually put my stuffing in when I lower my oven temp for the turkey)</p><p><br /></p><p>Gravy:</p><p>After turkey is done cooking remove vegetable bits from bottom of pan, place onto stove top. Whisk together 1/3 c. corn starch and a few tablespoons of warmed stock, until thinned BUT NOT LUMPY. Keep remaining stock warming in sauce pan. Turn on burners under roasting pan to medium heat. Slowly add corn starch slurry to pan being sure to whisk vigorously to loosen any fond from the bottom of the pan. Continue to add slurry until gravy is very thick and pale. SLOWLY add warmed stock, never stopping whisking, being sure to get into all the corners of the pan. Add stock until gravy is desired thickness. If gravy is too thin, make additional slurry. Remember, corn starch is heat activated! So err on the side of caution. Taste and adjust seasoning, the drippings should be very salty so a barely or unsalted broth is best. Can add a few teaspoons of white wine vinegar to cut through richness.&nbsp;</p><p><br /></p><p>Cranberry Sauce:</p><p>12 oz cranberry (1 package)</p><p>Peel of one orange, plus juice</p><p>1/2 c. sugar</p><p>1 fresh bay leaf</p><p>Small knob of ginger, halved (optional)</p><p>Pinch of kosher salt.</p><p>Boil over medium heat until berries burst and sauce begins to thicken. Let cool, remove ginger, bay leaves and orange peel. Can be pureed or sieved if you want a very smooth texture, I like it chunky.&nbsp;</p><p><br /></p><p>Green Bean Casserole:</p><p>Green beans can be prepared ahead of time, trim and cut into bite sized pieces. Bring large pot of water to boil, salt heavily. Once water is boiling add green beans (do this in batches if you have a lot of beans), cook until bright green and still very crunchy. Remove and place into ice water bath to stop cooking, cook remaining green beans. Drain and store until day of Thanksgiving.</p><p>Mushroom Soup:</p><p>Wash and slice 16oz of baby bella mushrooms. Cook over medium heat in a few tablespoons of vegetable oil until dark and all water has cooked off, making sure to salt and pepper early to help draw out moisture. Make sure you use a large enough pan, you don't want them to crowd and steam instead of brown. Once mushrooms are dark, add 1 tablespoon of butter and 1/2 a minced onion, cook 2-3 minutes. Once onions are translucent add 3 minced cloves of garlic, cook 2 minutes or until fragrant. Sprinkle over two tablespoons of corn starch, and slowly begin to whisk in 2 cups of milk. Make sure to add milk very slowly to prevent lumps. Once all the milk is added, bring to simmer and cook until thick and creamy. Taste and adjust salt and pepper. Can add any desired fresh or dried herbs. Cool and store until Thanksgiving day.</p><p>Fried Shallots:</p><p>Very thinly slice 4 shallots into rings. Heat vegetable oil in dutch oven until very hot. Add the shallots and fry until golden and very crisp. Place onto paper towel to dry and immediately salt. I think this can be done the day before, store in an air-tight container with paper towels.</p><p>To bake: Mix green beans and mushroom soup together and turn into baking dish. Bake at 350 for 1 hour until warmed and bubbly. Remove from oven and add crispy shallots.&nbsp;</p><p><br /></p><p><br /></p><p><br /></p>
