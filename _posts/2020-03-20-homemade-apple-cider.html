Just like that another recipe! and this time, its a drink recipe! We don't have too many of those so I'm excited to expand!<br />
<br />
I will preface this recipe by saying it is WORK IN PROGRESS. I only make it in the fall when we go apple picking and I'm up to my eyes in apples. Thus, I tweak it every time I make it, and <br />
I'm not convinced this is the final version. However, it helps me keep track of where I'm at with it, and what sort of steps I took the year previously.<br />
<br />
<br />
<a name='more'></a><b>Apple Cider</b><br />
<b>Ingredients</b><br />
10-12 apples, cored (not peeled) and quartered<br />
2 oranges, peeled and quartered<br />
4 cinnamon sticks<br />
16 cups of water<br />
1 whole nutmeg<br />
2 tsp whole cloves<br />
2 tsp whole allspice<br />
1 inch fresh ginger, scrubbed and sliced<br />
1/2 cup maple syrup<br />
1/4 cup brown sugar<br />
<b><br /></b>
<b>Directions</b><br />
1. Add all ingredients except the maple syrup and brown sugar to a large stock pot. Make sure you have an inch or two of headspace at the top of your pot.<br />
<br />
2. Heat over high heat and bring to a boil. Reduce to medium-low, cover, and simmer for around two hours, until apples are completely soft.<br />
<br />
3. Mash apples and oranges to release additional juice/flavor, then cover and simmer for another hour.<br />
<br />
4. Strain out solids starting with a larger mesh sieve and working down to a fine-mesh sieve or even cheese cloth.<br />
<br />
A few notes: I usually do one pass with a large sieve to remove the solids, then one to two passes with a fine mesh sieve to remove any smaller apple solids. When using the fine mesh sieve, try not to press the liquid through the sieve; it will push through grittier solid bits that prevent your cider from having a smooth texture. Instead, swirl the liquid to encourage it to pass through the sieve, and rinse/empty your sieve regularly to get those small-grain apple solids out of the way.<br />
<br />
5. Return to heat and add sweetener to taste (above are only guidelines, you could use honey or white sugar!)<br />
<br />
6. Serve warm or refrigerate. It will last a few weeks in the fridge or can be frozen. Whenever you want to serve, thaw or rewarm on the stove.&nbsp; You can garnish with orange slices and cinnamon stick, and pair with splash whiskey for a kick!
