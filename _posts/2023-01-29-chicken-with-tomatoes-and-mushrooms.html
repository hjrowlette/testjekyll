<p>&nbsp;Here's a quick and easy dinner idea!</p><p>Pat dry 2-4 chicken thighs (bone in or boneless), season with salt and pepper, Sear in Dutch oven until browned, and then remove.&nbsp;</p><p>Add 1 diced onion, saut√© until beginning to brown. Push to one side of the pan. Add 1 T. oil to empty side. Brown 4-5 mushrooms (baby bella, quartered) until golden. Add 2-3 minced cloves of garlic, cook until aromatic. Deglaze with ~1/3c. white wine. Add 1 12oz can of diced tomato, and 1 diced serrano or jalapeno. Bring to simmer, add chicken back in (if skin-on, leave skin side up). Bake in 350 oven, 15-20 minutes until chicken is cooked through. Taste and adjust salt and pepper, can also add dried or fresh basil or oregano. Served with rice and salad.</p><p>Britt Note - Added herbs de Provence to tomato/mush mix before adding chicken back in. 2 teaspoons.&nbsp;</p>
