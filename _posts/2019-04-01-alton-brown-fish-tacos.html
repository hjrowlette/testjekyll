This recipe has become a family icon--I think Mom and Dad were the first to make it, and it is too tasty for words.&nbsp; The prep fast, the cook time is faster, and the flavor packs a punch.&nbsp; Be careful not to oversalt and you can't go wrong!<br />

<b><span style="font-size: large;">Alton Brown Fish Tacos</span></b><br />
<b>Ingredients</b><br />
<i>for the fish</i><br />
-3 cloves garlic<br />
-1 cup packed cilantro leaves<br />
-2 limes, zested (save the limes for serving)<br />
-2 tsp ground cumin<br />
-1 1/2 tsp kosher salt (go light here, its easy to oversalt this recipe)<br />
-1 tsp black pepper<br />
-1/4 cup tequila<br />
-1 lb tilapia fillets<br />
-1 tbsp olive oil<br />
<br />
<i>to serve</i><br />
-tortillas<br />
-shredded red cabbage<br />
-lime wedges<br />
-crema (recipe below)<br />
<br />
<i>for crema</i><br />
-chipotle pepper in adobo sauce<br />
-heavy cream<br />
<br />
<b>Directions</b><br />
1. Put garlic, cilantro, lime zest, cumin, salt, and pepper in a small food processor and pulse until combined.&nbsp; With processor running, add tequila.&nbsp; Place tilapia fillets in 1-gallon resealable bag, add the garlic mixture and move around to coat each fillet.&nbsp; Let marinade at room temperature for 15-20 minutes<br />
<br />
2. Heat cast-iron pan over high heat, brushing with olive oil. Cook fillets until just cooked through and opaque, about 3-4 minutes per side.&nbsp; Do not overcrowd the pan, if necessary cook in 2 batches.<br />
<br />
3.&nbsp; Cut fish into strips and serve with warm tortillas with crema, shredded red cabbage, and lime wedges.<br />
<br />
<i>directions for crema (different from alton brown's recipe)</i><br />
1. Using a Vitamix/ Nutrininja small blender (or the food processor attachment on an immersion blender), combine 1 cup of heavy cream with one or two chipotle chiles plus some adobo sauce. Blend until a whipped cream forms; taste and add more chipotle or sauce until your desired level of spiciness is achieved.<br />
