<p>This one is for mom! I've got more Britt's Bites to do, but with 18 posts to go I wanted to make sure I got this up for you! I realized after thinking, that I had used Josh Weissman's recipe as a guidelines for these tacos. I didn't follow it totally, but when do I ever. But here is the link to his recipe:</p><p>https://www.joshuaweissman.com/post/birria-quesa-tacos&nbsp;</p><p>He also has a pretty good youtube video you can watch as well, it makes the recipe much more approachable when you get to visualize it.</p><p></p><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEianU30zNKdtxm3Qi9aO5R4s6dQhpW0xzfShaE-a1LsV-cCl4eRWvIa8YOBDAGtrtElJk6a1yfBGEBgurORZm27kDEbFIrTwv_nKr9lht5uyupamFd85bV9uabqQLu9M2KglMcdCNHC3hSwICJV7ZzG1p-354l9Gx-77HQYMVzei-9PKxyP5r1j_Q/s1500/birria-and-birria-tacos-12.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="clear: right; float: right; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 1em;"><img border="0" data-original-height="1500" data-original-width="1000" height="320" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEianU30zNKdtxm3Qi9aO5R4s6dQhpW0xzfShaE-a1LsV-cCl4eRWvIa8YOBDAGtrtElJk6a1yfBGEBgurORZm27kDEbFIrTwv_nKr9lht5uyupamFd85bV9uabqQLu9M2KglMcdCNHC3hSwICJV7ZzG1p-354l9Gx-77HQYMVzei-9PKxyP5r1j_Q/s320/birria-and-birria-tacos-12.jpg" width="213" /></a></div>https://youtu.be/4wORLNNsZc8&nbsp;<p></p><p>Ingredients:</p><p>2.5 lb chuck roast</p><p>1-2 lbs oxtail</p><p>5 ancho chilies</p><p>5 guajillo chilies</p><p>3 chilies de arbol</p><p>2.5 quarts high quality beef stock</p><p>2 Tbsp. tomato paste</p><p>1-2 yellow onions, minced (I like a lot of onion, can be adjusted based on size)</p><p>8 cloves garlic, sliced</p><p>1 cinnamon stick</p><p>3 bay leaves</p><p>1 Tbsp. toasted coriander seeds</p><p>1 Tbsp. toasted black pepper corns</p><p><span>&nbsp; &nbsp; - Note: you can toast both of these at the same time in a dry skillet. Watch carefully, they <span>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;</span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;</span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;</span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;</span><span>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</span>scorch&nbsp;quickly.&nbsp;</span><br /></p><p>2 Tbsp. oregano (fresh or dried)</p><p>Directions:</p><p>Remove stems and seeds from chilies. Toast dry spices if not done already.</p><p>Season meat generously with salt, and sear in heavy bottom pan until deep golden on all sides. Place into separate bowl. If less than 2 Tbsp of fat/oil in bottom of pot add additional oil.</p><p>Saut√© chopped onion until softened, then add tomato paste. Cook until tomato paste begins to darken, then add garlic and cook until fragrant. Deglaze with beef stock, making sure to get everything scraped off the bottom of the pot. Add in dried chilies and return the meat to the pot. Add remaining ingredients into cheese cloth, and tie tightly with kitchen twine. (This should be your cinnamon stick, bay leaves, coriander and black peppercorns, and oregano). Add into pot and bring to simmer.&nbsp;</p><p>Now listen, here's where a choice can be made. There are several options for cooking this meat. I'm lazy, and at this point like to move everything out of the pot and into my slow cooker and cook on low heat for 8 hours. Option 2, keep on stove top and braise for 1-2 hours. Option three, put in a 275 degree oven for 1-2 hours. However you do it, you want to cook this meat low and slow.</p><p>After the meat has cooked for either 4 hours in the slow cooker, or up to two hours on the stove top or in the oven. You are going to remove the chilies and place into a blender with a small amount of the stock and blend until smooth. Pour back into cooking vessel, and cook for an additional 1.5-2 hours (or remaining 4 in the slow cooker).&nbsp;</p><p>After remaining cooking time is done, remove and shred. Beef should shred with no effort at this point. Remove cheesecloth from broth, taste and adjust for salt. This is your consomme that the tacos are dipped in.&nbsp;</p><p>Now its time to make tacos:</p><p>Dip tortilla into broth and place onto nonstick pan, top with shredded cheese (Oaxaca is best, make sure to shred ahead of time) or mozzarella. You want a low moisture melty cheese, not queso fresco which is dry and won't melt. Once cheese is melted, add a generous serving of braised beef and a small spoon of consomme. This is going to be messy! Fold taco closed and flip, and cook for 1-2 minutes.</p><p>You are going to have a delightfully, wet, cheesy, toasted taco. Serve with a side of warm broth, minced onion and cilantro. These are best eaten while hot, I found a rotating system is best. Two tacos are typically the most I can make at a time, two people eat, move to the side, next people get the next two tacos and repeat. I ate at the end, it was just easiest! I wiped my skillet as it got too burnt or messy. Play it by ear, these are a lot to manage! They definitely do not need sour cream or additional cheese, they are so rich and you want to be able to appreciate the broth and beef you spent so much time on!&nbsp;</p><p>This is a great recipe, I hope you enjoy! Until next time, happy eating!&nbsp;<br />&nbsp;</p>
