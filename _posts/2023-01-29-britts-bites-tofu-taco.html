<p>&nbsp;Tofu Taco:</p><p>Quarter tofu block, salt and press over night (See tofu post for more detailed directions). Sear one side in canola oil (you don't need to sear it all over since it's going to be crumbled). Season heavily! Tofu needs it. Garlic and onion powder, cumin, chipotle chili, cayenne, salt. Then scramble and push to the sides, add one sliced onion and one minced hot pepper (like a jalapeno) to the pan and cook down. Add 2 roughly chopped cloves of garlic, cook until fragrant.&nbsp; You can add a can of diced tomatoes or some tomato paste if you'd like. Taste and adjust for salt and seasoning. Serve with avocado and corn tortilla. Enjoy!</p><p>Tofu Scramble:</p><p>Quarter tofu block, salt and press over night (See tofu post for more detailed directions). Sear tofu in large blocks, then scramble and remove from pan. Sear quartered mushrooms until brown. Remove. Saut√© diced onion, add garlic and cook until fragrant. Add any other desired veg, such as broccoli, green bell pepper, thawed peas, carrots, making sure they are cut into similar sized pieces. You can use frozen and thawed broccoli or peas. Cook veg until everything is just tender, add back mushrooms and tofu. Season with any combo of hoisin, teriyaki, siracha, rice vinegar or your favorite stir fry mix.&nbsp;</p><p>I like this one from Walmart.&nbsp;</p><p>https://www.walmart.com/ip/Cajun-Classics-Bamboo-Chef-Fried-Rice-Mix/324447002?wmlspartner=wlpa&amp;selectedSellerId=101091732&nbsp;</p><p>Taste and adjust, remember to season generously. I tend to mix and match whatever I have open in my fridge. Be careful of not oversalting, especially if you salted your tofu overnight.&nbsp; &nbsp;</p><p>Serve over rice with green onions for topping.&nbsp;</p>
