This recipe is such a great why to try out braising if it's a cooking method that you are unfamiliar with. The idea? Brown your meat until deep dark colors develop on all sides. Next, build a flavorful sauce based on the crispy bits left in the pan. Finish by adding the meat back in and cooking in the oven with the meat not quite submerged in the cooking liquid. This is something best started in the morning and left to cook over the afternoon. Then by dinner time the house smells amazing and all you need to do is whip up a side (like mashed or crispy potatoes) suited to soaking up all that delicious broth. The other nice thing? Short ribs are cheap! Okay not as cheap as discount red meat maybe, but certainly cheaper than a primo cut. It's so nice to take something affordable and upgrade it to something luxurious. If the ribs you buy are cut in slabs rather than squares you may be better off cutting them in half to allow more browning, but if that's too much work? Tally ho!<div><span><a name='more'></a></span><span><br /></span><div>Ingredients:</div></div><div><br /></div><div>5 lbs bone-in beef short ribs, but crosswise into 2-inch pieces.</div><div>Salt &amp; Pepper</div><div>3 T. vegetable oil</div><div>3 medium onions, chopped</div><div>3 medium carrots, peeled and chopped</div><div>2 celery stalks, chopped</div><div>3 T. all purpose flour (or GF)</div><div>1 T. tomato paste (try double-concentrated)</div><div>1 bottle dry red wine (like a Cab. Sauv)</div><div><br /></div><div>*side note* I don't do all of these herbs because I don't have an herb garden. When without, just add a teaspoon of dried</div><div>10 sprigs flat-leaf parsley (please tell me no one uses curly)</div><div>8 sprigs thyme</div><div>4 sprigs oregano</div><div>2 sprigs rosemary</div><div>2 fresh or dried bay leaves</div><div>1 head of garlic, halved crosswise</div><div>4 c. beef stock (low sodium)</div><div><br /></div><div>Directions:</div><div><br /></div><div>Preheat oven to 350. Season short ribs with salt and pepper. Heat oil in large Dutch oven over medium-high heat. Working in 2 (or more) batches, brown short ribs on all sides, about 8 minutes per batch. Don't crowd the pan!! When in doubt do more batches. Transfer ribs to a plate. Pour off all but 3 T. of drippings from pot, don't wipe out.</div><div><br /></div><div>Add onions, carrots, and celery to pot and cook over medium-high heat, stirring often, until onions are browned, about 5 minutes. Add flour and tomato paste; cook, stirring constantly, until well combined and deep red, 2-3 minutes. Stir in wine, then add short ribs with any accumulated juices. Bring to boil; lower heat to medium and simmer until wine is reduced by half, about 25 minutes. Add all herbs to pot along with garlic Stir in stock, bring to boil cover, and transfer to oven.</div><div><br /></div><div>Cook until ribs are tender, 2- 2 1/2 hours. Transfer ribs to plate and strain sauce. Spoon fat from surface and discard. Taste sauce and season with salt and pepper.</div><div><br /></div><div><br /></div><div>*A few notes*</div><div><br /></div><div>When I made this last I didn't need all the beef stock. I used ~ 3/4 bottle of wine and then adding just a cup of stock. You don't need the ribs to be swimming in liquid, just 3/4 covered. The next time I make this after it is all done, instead of putting it in the oven what if we try...the slow cooker?! I mean why not? It's a more constant temperature and you could cook it over low heat for 3 or 4 hours instead. If someone else doesn't try it, I will! Add mushrooms, or peas, or parsnips! Go crazy!</div><div><br /></div><div>Until next time,</div><div>Happy Eating!&nbsp;</div><div><br /></div><div><br /></div><div><a href="https://www.bonappetit.com/recipe/red-wine-braised-short-ribs">https://www.bonappetit.com/recipe/red-wine-braised-short-ribs</a>&nbsp;</div><div><br /></div>
