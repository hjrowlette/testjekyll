THE BEANS ARE BACK! I'll preface this by saying you can make this recipe with canned beans but hey, I didn't post a pot of beans recipe just for myself! wait...<br />
<br />
This is from my favorite comedian and her chef husband and their quarantine instagram cooking series, Don't Panic Pantry! They're on facebook and instagram live every day at 5pm PST, her name is Iliza Shlesinger if you wanna look her up, they're where I got the matzo brei recipe!<br />
<br />
Anyways,&nbsp; this is a lightning fast, super easy, and very nutritious dinner that I am honestly obsessed with :)<br />

<br />
<b>Ingredients</b><br />
1 undrained can of beans (or two cups) whatever beans you have<br />
1 bunch of greens again, whatever you have (kale, spinach, whatever works!)<br />
pinch of red pepper flakes<br />
2 garlic cloves, sliced<br />
pinch of oregano<br />
EVOO<br />
any other flavorings (soy sauce, vinegar, lemon, parmesan, hot sauce)<br />
<br />
1-2 eggs<br />
<br />
<b>Directions</b><br />
1. Put a bit of oil (enough to coat bottom) in skillet and set over medium heat.&nbsp; Add garlic and saute until just starting to brown at the edges. Add the chili flakes and stir.&nbsp; Then add the greens (if the greens are large like kale rip them into bite sized pieces)<br />
<br />
2.&nbsp; Season with salt and pepper and cook until wilted<br />
<br />
3.&nbsp; Add the beans, vinegar, soy sauce, lemon, etc that you are using, as well as the oregano or any other dry herbs<br />
<br />
3. Simmer until juices from beans have reduced but aren't totally evaporated. Season with salt and pepper and drop to low heat.<br />
<br />
4.&nbsp; Meanwhile, fry egg in a small pan. Add oil/butter and heat over medium. Crack egg and cook until whites are set and yolk is still runny (sunny side up). If you prefer you could do it over easy, poached, or even scrambled though!<br />
<br />
5. Transfer greens and beans mixture to your plate/bowl, and top with egg. Finish with parmesan, hot sauce, or anything else!
