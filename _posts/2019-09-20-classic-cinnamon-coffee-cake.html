All hail coffee cake! And not just any ol'&nbsp;coffee cake, gluten free coffee cake! It's reminiscent&nbsp;of cowboy coffee cake, all you need is&nbsp;some fresh fruit and of course, a cup of coffee. <br />
<a name='more'></a><br />
The original recipe designs a gluten free cake that is also paleo friendly and dairy free. Meaning it doesn't have any sugar or oil in addition to milk. Well I can't live without sugar! So I took it upon my self to try substitutes and the resulting cake was just slightly sweet. Perfect for breakfast without feeling like dessert. I didn't notice that the crumble stood out a lot to me, so I want to find a way to make it extra crumbly. I also didn't include the icing, because it calls for homemade icing sugar from maple sugar (umm, no). So I'll just sub it for regular icing sugar. <br />

1/3 c. brown sugar or maple syrup ( I did a combo of both to equal the final volume)<br />
1 1/2 tsp cinnamon<br />
1/4 c. butter, cold, cut into pieces<br />
<br />
Cake:<br />
3 eggs, room temp<br />
1/4 full fat milk<br />
1 Tbsp lemon juice<br />
3 Tbsp vegetable oil<br />
1/3 c. sugar<br />
1/3 c. brown sugar<br />
1 tsp vanilla<br />
2 c. almond flour<br />
1/4 c. arrowroot flour ( I use tapioca starch, it's a perfect substitution)<br />
1/2 tsp baking soda<br />
1/4 tsp. sea salt<br />
2 tsp cinnamon<br />
<br />
Icing:<br />
1/3 c&nbsp;icing sugar<br />
2 tbsp. arrowroot flour (see above)<br />
1/2 tsp cinnamon<br />
3-4 tsp full fat milk<br />
(a tablespoon of maple syrup would be delicious!)<br />
<br />
<br />
Directions:<br />
Preheat oven to 350, and line an 8x8" square cake pan with parchment paper along the bottom and sides.<br />
<br />
Prepare the crumble topping first. Place all ingredients in a bowl and combine using a fork or pastry blender until a coarse crumbly mixture forms. Place in fridge until ready to use.<br />
<br />
For the cake:<br />
In a medium bowl combine the almond flour, arrowroot (or tapioca), baking soda, salt and cinnamon, set aside. In a separate large bowl, whisk together the eggs, milk, lemon juice, sugar(s), oil and vanilla until very smooth. Stir the dry ingredients into the wet until well combined.<br />
<br />
Transfer batter to prepped pan, the batter with be somewhat thick. Spread evenly and top with crumble.<br />
<br />
Bake in preheated oven for 28-30 minutes until toothpick comes out clean.<br />
<br />
Allow to cool, drizzle with icing if desired and enjoy! Best served warm.<br />
