Its breakfast! Its dinner! Its delicious--and it can be customized any which way you want :) This post is more of a guideline that you can take and make your own--but its pretty tasty as is!&nbsp; Just make sure that whatever meat, veggies, etc you add are cooked before you add them, because your quiche is in the oven for a relatively short period of time.<br />
<br />
As for the crust, I recommend you use the pate brisee recipe I have posted on here, its great for quiche! The only other note I have is that if you want to make a quiche in larger than an 8-9 inch shell, add 1/2 cup milk or half and half for every egg you add, and increase the cheese and other ingredients accordingly. For the quiche in the picture to the right, I used 5 eggs and an extra cup of milk as well as some broccoli and tomato!<br />

<br />
<b>Ingredients&nbsp;</b><br />
8-9 inch brisee crust, fully baked<br />
1/2 cup grated gruyere<br />
1/2 cup chopped onions, sweated and drained<br />
4 oz chopped bacon, sauteed and drained<br />
1 1/2 cups half and half or whole milk<br />
3 eggs<br />
salt<br />
pepper<br />
<br />
<b>Directions</b><br />
1. Sprinkle cheese, onions, and bacon over the bottom of the tart shell (these will rise within the custard as it cooks)<br />
<br />
2. Whisk eggs in a bowl. Gradually add milk or half and half. Season well with salt and pepper<br />
<br />
3. Strain custard through fine mesh sieve<br />
<br />
4. Pour custard into tart shell.&nbsp; Custard will expand slightly when it bakes, so only fill the shell 3/4 full<br />
<br />
5. Bake at 300 to 325 degrees until the quiche feels just firm to the touch and jiggles slightly in the center (for 9 inch dish, it should be around 30-40 minutes). Quiche should be lightly browned when finished.&nbsp; Serve lukewarm.&nbsp; Can be baked a few hours in advance and reheated.
