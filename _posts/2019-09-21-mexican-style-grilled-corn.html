It's been so long, I'm glad I remember how to post XD Well the good news is I'm coming back in serious style with a recipe thats going to blow. your. mind.<br />
<br />
Mexican corn.<br />
<br />
I know the title says grilled, but honestly you could easily cook your corn on the stove in a cast iron or roast it in the oven to get that same charred effect with devastatingly delicious results!<br />
<br />
This recipe is fast, easy, and goes great if you are grilling meat or burgers and need a side with some serious flavor!<br />

<b>Ingredients:</b><br />
1 1/2 ounces grated Pecorino Romano cheese (3/4 cup) (could also use cotija!)<br />
1/4 cup mayo<br />
3 tbsp sour cream<br />
3 tbsp minced fresh cilantro<br />
4 tsp lime juice<br />
1 garlic clove, minced<br />
3/4 tsp chili powder<br />
1/4 tsp pepper<br />
1/4 tsp cayenne pepper<br />
4 tsp vegetable oil<br />
1/4 tsp salt<br />
6 ears of corn, husks and silk removed<br />
<br />
<b>Directions:</b><br />
1.&nbsp; Prepare charcoal or gas grill as you normally would for direct heating (high heat on gas grill).<br />
<br />
2. Combine pecorino, mayo, sour cream, cilantro, lime juice, garlic, 1/4 tsp chili powder, pepper, and cayenne in a large bowl and set aside.<br />
<br />
3. In a small dish, combine the oil, salt, and remaining 1/2 tsp of chili powder. Brush this mixture onto the corn.<br />
<br />
4. Place corn on grill and cook until lightly charred on all sides, 7-12 minutes, turning as needed. Once the corn is cooked remove from grilled and rub cheese mixture all over the cobs to coat.
