<p>&nbsp;HURRY! THERE'S NO TIME! just kidding, this recipe is just stupid quick and easy so I'm throwing it up here! This is my new favorite way to eat green beans--they stay gorgeously crisp, go great in a salad, can be finished on the stove in a sauce of your choice, or are just the best standalone snack you can reach for!</p><p><br /></p><p><b>Ingredients</b></p><p>green beans. duh.</p><p>that's it.</p><p><br /></p><p><b>Directions</b></p><p>1. Bring a large pot of water to boil on the stove.</p><p>2. GENEROUSLY SALT THE WATER ONCE IT COMES TO A BOIL. I MEAN GENEROUSLY. You actually want it salty like the sea, the green beans are in there so little time that they need the extra salty water.</p><p>3. Dump in green beans. Cook 90 seconds (maybe an extra 30 seconds bit more if you're doing a huge amount of beans).</p><p>4. Quickly drain, and rinse beans in cold water. Stick beans in a bath of ice water until they have cooled.</p><p>5. Add to a salad, leave in the fridge as a snack, or finish in a warm pan with some butter or sauce. Enjoy!</p>
