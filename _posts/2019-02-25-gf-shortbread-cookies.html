It's mee, back with another story from my journey down the road of gluten free baking--on this week's episode--shortbread cookies!<br />
<br />
Calling these cookies is a bit of a misnomer, because they're actually a biscuit.&nbsp; Which makes sense because I can confirm, they pair beautifully with a cup of afternoon tea :)<br />
<br />
Now you may be asking, "Hannah, who even cares about shortbread cookies? Aren't they the same thing as sugar cookies?"<br />
<br />
NO. OF COURSE THEY'RE NOT THE SAME. IF THEY WERE THE SAME I WOULD BE POSTING A GUIDE TO GLUTEN FREE SUGAR COOKIES, NOT GLUTEN FREE SHORTBREAD COOKIES YA DUMMY.<br />

<br />
Shortbread cookies, while containing the same key ingredients as sugar cookies, have a much higher ratio of fat to flour than in sugar cookies. What this means is you're left with a cookie that tastes more buttery than sugary.&nbsp; Additionally, shortbread cookies have no leavening agents so they stay relatively compact and crumbly.<br />
<br />
Sugar cookies, because of the higher flour to fat ratio, are much better suited for cutouts and decorating because the extra flour helps stabilize your dough, and shortbread cookies are often laid out in a pan and then cut into simple squares after baking. That being said, when I made these cookies I did do cutouts (and I decorated them as well), although the cutout I did was very simple.<br />
<br />
I don't have much advice to these cookies, they are super fast and easy and the most important thing is just to not overwork your dough, or your cookies will end up tougher.&nbsp; You can make these cookies chocolate by substituting 1/3 cup flour for 1/3 cup cocoa powder.&nbsp; I just used King Arthur Gluten Free Cup-for-Cup flour, and it worked perfectly!<br />
<br />
The recipe is based off a Bon Appetit recipe that I modified a bit, but I've still included the link for the original: <a href="https://www.bonappetit.com/recipe/zebra-striped-shortbread-cookies">https://www.bonappetit.com/recipe/zebra-striped-shortbread-</a><br />
<br />
I used our gingerbread glue icing recipe to decorate because it is so easy, beautifully glossy, and it hardens so quickly. I've posted the link a few times on this blog so I'll let you do a little hunting to find it ðŸ˜›<br />

<b><br /></b>
<b>Ingredients</b><br />
2 1/3 cup all-purpose flour (or Cup-for-Cup Gluten Free Flour)<br />
1 1/2 tsp kosher salt<br />
1 1/4 cup (2 1/2 sticks) unsalted butter, room temperature<br />
2/3 cup granulated sugar<br />
1/4 cup powdered sugar<br />
1 large egg yolk<br />
1 tsp vanilla extract<br />
<br />
1/3 cup cocoa powder (if using, only use 2 cups flour)<br />

<b>Directions</b><br />
1. Preheat oven to 350.<br />
<br />
2. Whisk flour and salt (and cocoa if using) in medium bowl, and set aside.<br />
<br />
3. In a large bowl beat butter, granulated sugar, and powdered sugar on medium-high speed until light and fluffy, about 4 minutes.<br />
<br />
4. Add egg yolk and vanilla and beat until smooth.<br />
<br />
5. Add dry ingredients to large bowl and beat on low speed just until combined. You want large crumbles and no loose flour (see picture).<br />
<br />
6. Place half of dough between two large sheets of parchment paper and roll out evenly to 1/4" thickness.&nbsp; If making cut outs, cut desired shape, placing onto a cookie sheet lined with parchment paper. Repeat with remaining dough.<br />
<br />
7. If not making cutouts, place rolled out dough (with parchment paper beneath) onto baking sheet.<br />
<br />
8. Bake for 8-12 minutes, rotating baking sheets halfway through. (I went in 4 minute increments and they baked in 8 minutes, but it will depend on your cutout)<br />
<br />
Dough can be made 3 days ahead; keep chilled until use.&nbsp; Cookies can be baked 5 days ahead; store airtight at room temperature.
