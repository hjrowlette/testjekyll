Could the title be any longer? I think not! But it does fully encompass all of the things going on in this soup! It comes together very quickly and goes well with a salad for a complete dinner. Or throw in some noodles and make it a noodle soup! Bring on the cold temperatures, we're ready!<br />

Thai Coconut Curry Shrimp Soup<br />
<br />
Ingredients:<br />
EVOO<br />
1 onion, diced small<br />
3 cloves of garlic, minced or grated<br />
2 Tb. ginger, minced or grated<br />
2 Tb. red curry paste<br />
1 red bell pepper (or a mix of your favorites) sliced thin<br />
5-6 oz. mushrooms, sliced thin<br />
4 cups chicken broth<br />

2 Tb. fish sauce<br />
2 Tb. soy sauce<br />
1 tsp. brown sugar<br />
1 lb. large raw shrimp, shell and tail removed<br />
<br />
To serve: sliced green onions and lime wedges<br />
<br />
Directions:<br />
In a dutch oven add 2 tablespoons of olive oil and the onion over medium heat, saut√© until just softened, but not browned. Add the grated ginger and garlic and cook until aromatic, 1-2 minutes. Add curry paste and stir to mix. Add the peppers and mushroom and cook until just beginning to soften. Add the chicken stock, coconut milk, fish sauce, soy sauce and brown sugar. Taste and adjust for salt and pepper. Bring to a low boil, adding more curry paste if you are looking for more flavor (or heat!). Once the soup is at a simmer add the thawed shrimp and cook until just done, 3-4 minutes. Serve immediately with onions and lime.<br />
<br />
A few notes:<br />
I held back half of my peppers and mushroom and added after the soup began to simmer, they stayed crisp tender and added a little texture to the broth.<br />
My coconut milk had broken in the can because I did not shake it. It look like curdled milk and totally unappetizing. Fear not! Break out the ol' whisk and give it a firm but gentle mixing. Since the veggies are already added you can't use an immersion blender but the whisk helped break up the coconut milk and meld with the chicken broth. Once I mixed it it looked much better!<br />
Feel free to add noodles to give this brothy soup some body and make it a full meal. Or enjoy without for something on the lighter side.<br />
<br />
Until next time,<br />
Happy Eating!
