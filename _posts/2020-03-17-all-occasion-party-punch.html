How's everyone doing? Surviving this crazy virus that has taken over all aspects of our life? Hopefully you're practicing good health habits, socially distancing, and taking care of yourself!<br />
<br />
I know it seems like a weird time to be posting a party punch recipe when we are supposed to be 6 feet away from each other at all times but hey, this can't last forever! And when things start getting back to normal you better believe I'm gonna be throwing a party to celebrate :D<br />
<br />
There are a million and one party punch recipes on facebook, instagram, pinterest, or whatever social media site is your favorite, but I think this one is super easy, appeals to a lot of people, and contains stuff you can find easily at any grocery store. Because lets be honest, some of those pinterest recipes can get a little...whacky sounding.<br />
<br />
<br />
The other thing I like about this recipe is that you can make it alcoholic or non-alcoholic based on your preference, and you can also easily adjust how much alcohol by simply swapping the sierra mist for champagne for a lighter drink, or adding vodka for an extra punch!<br />
<br />
One final note: this is our inaugural drink recipe on the blog! CAN YOU BELIEVE THAT? 75 recipes in, and this is our first sippy one--how awesome!<br />

<b>All Occasion Party Punch (Alcoholic or Non-Alcoholic!)</b><br />
Serves 12-16<br />
<br />
<b>Ingredients</b><br />
2 L sprite (or champagne)<br />
64 oz (standard size bottle) cranberry juice<br />
52 oz (standard size bottle) orange juice<br />
1 cup vodka (if you desire) (I used equal parts raspberry and lime)<br />
1 cup triple sec (if you desire)<br />
<br />
*I would note if you <u>don't</u> use champagne but <u>do</u> use vodka, you can add up to 3 cups of vodka. If you use&nbsp;champagne <u>and</u> vodka I recommend using only the volumes of vodka listed above so that you can, you know, still stand after a glass of it*<br />
<br />
<b>Directions</b><br />
1. Mix together cranberry, orange juice, and vodka (if you desire)<br />
<br />
2. Add sprite or champagne just before serving<br />
<br />
3. Serve over ice. Garnish with fresh orange slices
