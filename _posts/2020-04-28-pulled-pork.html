Another recipe I make regularly but seem to struggle with finding when I want it. So here it is so I don't lose it again! This is the best pulled pork I've ever had. One thing I didn't realize until I made this was pulled pork and BBQ pulled pork are not mutually exclusive. This recipe is NOT barbecue. But the wonderful thing about it is that its still totally appropriate for a cookout and it is delicious if you serve it with several sauces on the side and everyone can sauce to their hearts content....or not!<br />

<br />
Ingredients:<br />
<br />
2 T. kosher salt, preferably smoked<br />
2 T. packed dark brown sugar<br />
2 T paprika<br />
1 T. fresh ground black pepper<br />
1 T. chili powder<br />
1 T. smoked paprika<br />
2 t. dry mustard<br />
2 t. garlic powder (not salt)<br />
2 t. onion powder<br />
1 t. cornstarck<br />
1/2 t. cayenne<br />
1/2 t. celery seeds<br />
1 pork shoulder or pork butt (7-8 lbs bone-in, or 6-7 lbs boneless)<br />
2 medium onions, quarterd<br />
1 1/2 cups cane-sweetened cola (not diet or artificial sweetners)<br />
1 c. apple cider vinegar<br />
2 T. Worcestershire sauce<br />
<br />
Directions:<br />
<br />
Heat oven to 500 degrees. Line a rimmed baking sheet with aluminum foil, then fit a wire rack inside. I like to use my turkey roasting pan and rack. It works very well!<br />
<br />
Make spice rub. Combine salt, brown sugar, paprika, black pepper, chili powder, smoked paprika, dry mustard, garlic &amp; onion powder, cornstarch, cayenne, and celery seeds in a small bowl and mix.<br />
<br />
Pat the pork dry with paper towels and evenly coat with 1/2 of the rub, then place on the wire rack fat-side up. Roast until pork is sizzling with a little bit of char, about 10-15 minutes. Watch carefully to prevent the spices from burning and becoming acrid.<br />
<br />
While pork roasts place onion in large slow cooker. Sprinkle with remaining rub. Pour in cola, vinegar and worcestershire. Mix to combine.<br />
<br />
After pork is nice and browned place in slow cooker on top of onion mixture. Cover and cook on LOW until pork is soft enough to break apart with a spoon. 14-16 hours. Starting in the evening and letting this go overnight is easiest in my opinion.<br />
<br />
Transfer meat to large bowl and let stand until cool enough to handle. Pull meat apart into large chunks, discarding any bone, connective tissue or large clumps of fat as you go. This is best done while the pork is still warm. I wouldn't recommended refrigeration until you do this. Shredding cold meat and finding the undesirable parts is much harder.<br />
<br />
Strain remaining liquid through fine-mesh strainer. Strain as much fat off as possible before adding back to meat if serving immediately. Once everything is cool, or after refrigerating the meat and strained liquid separately, add enough cooking liquid back into meat to moisten.<br />
<br />
This would be a great time to add barbecue to the meat or serve on the side with all your other favorite pulled pork sides. Baked beans! Cottage cheese! Brats! Go crazy.<br />
<br />
Until next time, happy eating!<br />
