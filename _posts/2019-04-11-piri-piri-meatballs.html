This recipe was such a great find from BA. It's delicious! I've never had meatballs quite like this before. I followed the recipe exactly (but with GF breadcrumbs), served with full-fat Greek&nbsp;yogurt and oven roasted broccoli! Delicious!<br />

<br />
Ingredients:<br />
<br />
<br />
Piri-Piri Sauce<br />
<br />
1/2 cup jarred roasted red peppers, drained<br />
1 red fresno chile, stemmed, seeded (I used a jalapeno)<br />
1 small garlic clove<br />
3 Tbsp. EVOO<br />
2 Tbsp. red wine vinegar <br />
1 1/2 tsp. kosher salt<br />
1 tsp. smoked paprika<br />
<br />
Meatballs and Assembly<br />
<br />
2/3 cup panko (Japanese breadcrumbs)<br />
1 large egg<br />
2 garlic cloves, finely grated<br />
1 1/4 tsp. kosher salt<br />
3/4 tsp. ground cumin<br />
1/2 tsp. smoked paprika<br />
1 Tbsp. EVOO<br />
1 lb ground beef, divided<br />
3/4 cup whole-milk Greek yogurt<br />
<br />
Directions:<br />
<br />
Sauce<br />
Puree red peppers, chile, garlic, oil, vinegar, salt, and paprika in a blender until very smooth. Transfer to small bowl.<br />
<br />
Meatballs:<br />
Preheat oven to 450. Mix panko, 2 Tbsp. piri-piri sauce and 1 Tbsp. water with a fork in a medium bowl to hydrate panko. Add egg and mash together with a fork until paste is homogenous, about 1 minute. Let sit until panko is softened, about 3 minutes. Add garlic, salt, cumin, paprika and 1 Tbsp. oil and stir to incorporate. Add about 1/3 of the hamburger and gently work into panko mixture with your hands until it no longer feels wet and is well incorporated. Add remaining ground beef and gently combine again until evenly dispersed and homogenous.<br />
<br />
Form ground beef mixture into twelve 2"- diameter balls. Space evenly on a foil-lined rimmed baking sheet.<br />
<br />
Bake meatballs 5 minutes, then turn on broiler (you can leave the meatballs in the oven while the broiler heats up) and broil until golden brown and just barely cooked through, 5-6 minutes longer.<br />
<br />
Serve with yogurt and the rest of the sauce, drizzle with additional olive oil if desired.<br />
