Last one for the night because it is past my bedtime! I recently tried an eggplant recipe that had this amazing sauce that went with it, and I'm totally obsessed. It required a ridiculous amount of garlic which is always a good thing, and was easy to whip together. I loved it on the eggplant, but the possibilities are endless with this bad boy.<div><br /></div><div>Whip this up the next time you have the grill heated or oven at 400, and spread liberally on literally anything else you cook the rest of the week. you're welcome ;)</div><span><a name='more'></a></span><div>Garlic Yogurt Tahini Sauce</div><div>Ingredients</div><div>2 heads garlic</div><div>1 cup plain greek yogurt</div><div>2 tbsp tahini</div><div>kosher salt</div><div><br /></div><div>Directions</div><div>1. Grill whole head of garlic over indirect heat until cloves are tender and jammy, 40-50 minutes. Alternatively, cut off the top of the garlic head, pour on a tsp of EVOO, wrap in foil, and bake at 400 degrees for 40 minutes.</div><div><br /></div><div>2. Mix yogurt and tahini in a small bowl; season with salt. Squeeze out the garlic cloves into the yogurt mixture, and stir to incorporate.</div><div><br /></div><div>That's it! use immediately or pop in the fridge and reach for it any time you want something to slather on a roasted veggie, fresh, or leftover. It would probably make a tasty cold dip as well!</div>
