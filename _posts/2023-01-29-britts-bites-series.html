<p>&nbsp;Welcome, welcome one and all! Today, we have a fabulous show in store. So sit back and relax and enjoy the ride...&nbsp;</p><p>And what is that ride you may ask? Well, this series of posts will be called "Britt's Bites," the idea is that by labeling all the posts this way you'll know what you're getting into before you click. And what exactly are you getting into? A quick trip into the chaos of my brain when I'm cooking something new. These aren't going to be polished posts. Sometimes, when I'm trying things for the first time, I'm compounding several recipes I've seen online in additional to techniques and flavors I already know. Sometimes, I'm following a wild idea and have no clue what I'm doing.&nbsp;</p><p>Freestyling in the kitchen, is something I've really come to enjoy. And Michael and I have both reaped the benefits! I'm proud of what I've done, and I'm excited to share it with you.</p><p></p><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEgefXUFIlagvHrb54c-mbWZMhW5hueDVqfehoVdekouQaKAk1pBOK6lifN4Vo8WPz7uTVZu6yuHR5u711RhQKBbn1_Gb5JZnBZtUjiWaxDTJf1DV2JQWUfF4OxDUC6YCKbafWVu50YNoSVa0lMvCHfVq6IL0ewezi5soEnjp2dlidMD-SSCSgcJxw/s4032/20221123_122105.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="clear: left; float: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" data-original-height="4032" data-original-width="3024" height="347" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEgefXUFIlagvHrb54c-mbWZMhW5hueDVqfehoVdekouQaKAk1pBOK6lifN4Vo8WPz7uTVZu6yuHR5u711RhQKBbn1_Gb5JZnBZtUjiWaxDTJf1DV2JQWUfF4OxDUC6YCKbafWVu50YNoSVa0lMvCHfVq6IL0ewezi5soEnjp2dlidMD-SSCSgcJxw/w260-h347/20221123_122105.jpg" width="260" /></a></div>These posts should be interpreted as guidelines, not a hard and fast recipe. I've been trying to get into the habit of writing things down after I've cooked and eaten, so the next time I want to repeat something, I have a rough idea of what I did and how I can improve. Often, I don't measure when I'm cooking. So when I'm writing the recipe down after the fact, its a rough estimate of what I've done. Sometimes I go back to make something again and I'll realize I definitely missed a step, or mis-measured something.<p></p><p>As I post these, I'll try to update them with any additional notes I've made and categorize by date. I hope these are helpful, and give you a fun look into what's happening in my kitchen. Please interpret wildly and don't be afraid to edit a post and pop something down that you've tried. I'd love to know when you try something and what you think!</p><p>Until then, enjoy this series and as always, Happy Eating!&nbsp;</p><p><br /></p>
