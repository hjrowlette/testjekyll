This recipe is one that comes from Brittany in Florida.&nbsp; She coached me through making it one afternoon and I fell in love!&nbsp; Its short, simple, and delicious! Hunter requested the recipe from Brittany, I asked Hunter for the recipe,&nbsp; Hannah has since been asking.... it is in high demand, so hence, here it is!&nbsp; &nbsp;Brit, please edit as appopriate, I am just your pinch hitter on this one so I will need a check up :D<br />
<br />
<b>Ingredients</b><br />
<br />
Pork&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;( original recipe was made with a pork loin, a roast, or chops will also work, just adjust your<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;cooking time until the meat is tender)<br />
1&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;large onion thinly sliced<br />
2&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;granny smith apples peeled, cored, thinly sliced<br />
2 Tbsp apple cider vinegar<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;whole grain mustard (any brown, grey mustard should do the trick )<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;salt and pepper<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;neutral oil<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;fresh sprig of rosemary or two teaspoons dried rosemary<br />
<br />
<b>Directions</b><br />
<b><br /></b>
1.&nbsp; Preheat the oven to 350F.&nbsp; Heavily salt and pepper the meat ( all sides if a roast or loin, if chops, hold the salt on the second side until you are ready to flip it over) Using med high/high heat, add a couple tablespoons of olive oil or other neutral oil in a cast iron, dutch oven, or other heavy pan for searing.<br />
<br />
2. When your oil is hot, brown your roast until a rich brown on all sides, brown your chops on one side, salt, then brown on the other side. Work the chops in batches, to avoid crowding the pan.&nbsp; After meat is browned, remove from pan.<br />
<br />
3. In the same pan, add your onion and apple over medium heat and cook until just wilting.&nbsp; Stir in the cider vinegar, deglaze the pan and turn the heat off. It would be optional to add some apple cider/juice or a bit of white wine at this point.<br />
<br />
4.&nbsp; Coat the surface, all sides of your meat, with the mustard. Settle the meat back in the pan amongst the apple and onion. Add the rosemary to the top.<br />
<br />
5. Put a lid on it! Bake! Chops cooked in about an hour and were fall off the bone tender.&nbsp; Roast will vary depending on the weight and if there is a bone. 2-3 lb loin may be just about an hour, 4-5 lb roast may go 1.5 hours or longer. Temp it.<br />
<br />
6. Toss some washed, cut potatoes with olive oil, salt and pepper and bake these on a cookie sheet in that oven as well.&nbsp; Crispy delight goes great with this tender tasty pork!<br />
