<br />
<a name='more'></a><br />
Now my mother can testify that I like carbonara--we ate it in Rome and it was absolutely incredible. Interestingly, carbonara does not have a long history in the big scheme of famous italian pasta dishes. Some of the first recorded mentions of carbonara pasta were in the 1940s during the American liberation of Rome during WWII, and the first recorded recipes didn't surface until a few years after that in the early 1950s. However, there are many debating theories about the true origins of the dish that, while I found fascinating, aren't quite germane to the recipe. I'll include a link at the bottom for the nerds like me who are curious!<br />
<br />
Carbonara is at its heart a pretty simple pasta dish, and any classic italian carbonara (in my humble opinion ðŸ˜‰) recipe has no more than 6 ingredients: guanciale (or bacon for those of us who can't find guanciale), spaghetti, eggs, parmesan, pecorino romano, and fresh black pepper.<br />
<br />
Notice what's missing from that list? garlic, onion, cream, and herbs of any sort. Weird for an italian pasta dish right? But honestly this dish doesn't need it.&nbsp; To me, any recipe that calls for those ingredients is not a true italian carbonara.&nbsp; That's not to say you can't make a dish tasty by adding them, but I don't think you can call it a classic carbonara if you do.<br />
<br />
Pasta alla carbonara is perfectly creamy because of the egg yolk, fatty from the guanciale, rich from the cheese, and with a little bite from the fresh black pepper. What else could you ask for in a pasta dish?<br />
<br />
Below is a fantastic carbonara recipe if you want to try it out for yourself, and I'll also include the link for the BA Recipe that started the discussion--its a vegetarian spin on carbonara that uses mushrooms instead of pork. I imagine the dish is pretty tasty and if Brit doesn't try it out I certainly will be tempted; HOWEVER, in my mind I really struggle to consider it a carbonara because its just got too many things going on that break from the classic carbonara formula.<br />
<br />
The recipe below is relatively simple (just like the ingredients!), the only tricky part is when you add your egg mixture to the pasta--the best advice I can offer is stir your pasta quickly and stream your egg mixture slowly, and you shouldn't end up with scrambled egg pasta. Having a second set of hands can definitely help because one person can vigorously mix the pasta while the other is pouring your eggs.<br />
<br />
Regardless of which variation of carbonara you prefer, happy eating!<br />

<b><span style="font-size: large;">Spaghetti Alla Carbonara&nbsp;</span></b><br />
<b><span style="font-size: large;"><br /></span></b>
<b>Ingredients</b><br />
<div class="MsoNormal">
1 pound dry spaghetti<o:p></o:p></div>
<div class="MsoNormal">
4 large eggs, as fresh as possible<o:p></o:p></div>
<div class="MsoNormal">
8 ounces guanciale, pancetta or slab bacon, cubed<o:p></o:p></div>
<div class="MsoNormal">
1/2 cup freshly grated Parmigiano-Reggiano<o:p></o:p></div>
<div class="MsoNormal">
1/2 cup freshly grated Pecorino<o:p></o:p></div>
<div class="MsoNormal">
Freshly cracked black pepper<o:p></o:p></div>
Sea salt<br />
<div class="MsoNormal">
<o:p></o:p></div>
<div class="MsoNormal">
<br /></div>
<div class="MsoNormal">
<b>Directions</b></div>
<div class="MsoNormal">
1. Bring about 6 quarts of generously salted water (it should be salty when you taste it) to a boil. Add the spaghetti and cook for 8 to 10 minutes
or until al dente. When the pasta is done, reserve 1/2 cup of the water, then
drain.<o:p></o:p></div>
<div class="MsoNormal">
<br /></div>
<div class="MsoNormal">
2. While the pasta is cooking, heat a large skillet (cast
iron works great here) over medium heat. Add the guanciale and sautÃ© for about
3 minutes, or until the meat is crispy and golden and has rendered its fat.
Turn off the heat.<o:p></o:p></div>
<div class="MsoNormal">
<br /></div>
<div class="MsoNormal">
3. In a small bowl whisk the eggs and the cheeses until
well-combined.<o:p></o:p></div>
<div class="MsoNormal">
<br /></div>
<div class="MsoNormal">
4. Return the guanciale pan to medium heat, and add half of
the reserved pasta water to the pan. Toss in the spaghetti and agitate the pan
over the heat for a few seconds until the bubbling subsides. Much of the water
will evaporate<o:p></o:p></div>
<div class="MsoNormal">
<br /></div>
<div class="MsoNormal">
5. Remove the pan from the heat and add the egg mixture and
stirring quickly until the eggs thicken. The residual heat will cook the eggs
but you must stir quickly to prevent the eggs from scrambling. If the sauce
seems too thick, thin it out with a little bit more of the reserved pasta
water.<o:p></o:p></div>
<div class="MsoNormal">
<br /></div>
<div class="MsoNormal">
6. Season liberally with freshly cracked black pepper. Taste
for seasoning; depending on the kind of pork used, it may not need any salt.<o:p></o:p></div>
<div class="MsoNormal">
</div>
<div class="MsoNormal">
<br /></div>
<div class="MsoNormal">
7. Divide the pasta into bowls and serve immediately.<o:p></o:p><br />
