Heyo you happy meat eaters! This is a very beloved recipe that I really can't claim credit for.&nbsp; As you all know, I am a poor city dweller with no space for a grill :( as a result I struggled to find ways to cook nicer cuts of beef that I don't want to overcomplicate or overcook.&nbsp; That's where this recipe has been a godsend.&nbsp; All you need is your steak, some butter, and a cast iron (fresh herbs and garlic are a perfect finishing touch). I don't have much to say about this one, its delicious, fast and easy, and would pair really well if you are making a more complex side dish that requires more of your energy!<br />

<br />
<b><span style="font-size: large;">Pan-Seared Strip Steak</span></b><br />
<br />
<b>Ingredients</b><br />
-2 12-ounce lean, grass-fed New York strip steaks (or whatever steak you purchase)<br />
-1 tsp kosher salt<br />
-3/4 tsp black pepper<br />
-1 tbsp olive oil<br />
-2 tbsp butter<br />
-2 thyme sprigs (rosemary is also AMAZING)<br />
-2 garlic cloves, crushed<br />
<br />
<b>Directions</b><br />
1. Let steaks sit for 30 minutes at room temperature.<br />
<br />
2. Sprinkle steaks evenly with salt and pepper. Heat large cast iron skillet over high heat.&nbsp; Add oil to the pan, and swirl to coat.<br />
<br />
3. Add steaks to the pan; cook three minutes on each side or until browned.&nbsp; Reduce heat to medium-low; add butter, thyme, and garlic to pan.&nbsp; Carefully grasping the pan's handle, tilt the pan away from you slightly so the butter pools; cook 1 1/2 minutes, constantly basting steaks with butter.<br />
<br />
4. Remove steaks from pan; cover loosely with foil. Let stand 10 minutes.&nbsp; Reserve butter mixture<br />
<br />
5. Cut steak across the grain into slices; discard thyme and garlic, and spoon reserved butter mixture over steak.
