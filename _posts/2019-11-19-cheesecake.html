<span style="font-family: inherit;">Cheesecake! What an easy dessert to make and turn into whatever you desire. Sub GF graham crackers, add a caramel drizzle, or a cookie crust, fresh fruit, or canned cherry topping, etc. So flexible! Here is my recipe that I made last year that was a huge hit. Feel free to riff it however you desire. Highly recommend letting your ingredients come to room temperature before hand, it lends to a smooth creamy filling.</span><br />
<a name='more'></a><span style="font-family: inherit;"><span face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><span>Ingredients:</span><br /><span>Crust-</span><br /><span>2 cups (GF) graham cracker crumbs (about 1 box of crackers)</span><br /><span>2 T. Sugar</span><br /><span>4 T. unsalted butter, melted</span><br /><span><br /></span><span>Filling-</span></span></span><div><span style="font-family: inherit;"><span face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><span>24 oz. cream cheese, room temp. (Philadelphia)</span><br /><span>1 1/2 c. (12 oz.) sour cream, room temp.</span><br /><span>3/4 c. sugar</span><br /><span>5 large eggs, room temp.</span><br /><span>1 tsp. vanilla</span><br /></span></span><div><span style="font-family: inherit;"><br /><span face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Directions:</span></span></div><div><span style="font-family: inherit;"><br /><span face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Preheat oven to 350 and grease springform pan very well.</span></span></div><div><span style="font-family: inherit;"><br /></span></div><div><span style="font-family: inherit;">Pulse crackers until finely ground, add melted butter and sugar, mix well. Turn into pan, press against sides (helps to use the bottom of a flat glass). Make sure pan is evenly coated, chill 15 minutes, or up to 2 days. Bake 12-15 minutes. Cool before filling.</span></div><div><span style="font-family: inherit;"><br /><span face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Combine cream cheese, sour cream and sugar in a bowl. Beat until smooth.&nbsp; Crack eggs into separate bowl, add to mix one at a time, beating well after each addition. Add vanilla and beat 1 additional minute. Pour filling into crust and tap to settle.</span></span></div><div><span style="font-family: inherit;"><br /><span face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">For the baking:</span><br /></span><br />
<div style="font-variant: normal; letter-spacing: normal; margin: 0px; text-align: left; text-decoration: none; text-indent: 0px; text-transform: none; white-space: normal; word-spacing: 0px;">
<span style="font-family: inherit;">Bake cheesecake 45-50 minutes. Edges will firm up and center will still jiggle. Turn off oven, leave cheesecake in oven for 40 minutes. Remove from oven and cool on stove top before moving to fridge overnight still in the springform pan and covered with foil. After at least one night in the fridge remove and serve.&nbsp;</span></div>
<span style="font-family: inherit;"><b></b><i></i><u></u><sub></sub><sup></sup><strike></strike><div><span style="font-family: inherit;"><br /></span></div>I tried the 'wet bake' method last year (2018) and it really didn't seem worth it. I had to wrap the pan with foil, really really well to keep out the water from the bath. Plus finding a pan deep enough to hold the water and the actual cake, and being sure not to use cold water....it was a lot. SO this year (2019) I'm doing a dry bake! I'm hoping it will be just as good. I'm going to stick with my baking time from last year and hope that it stays true, updates to come!</span></div><div><span style="font-family: inherit;"><br /></span></div><div><span style="font-family: inherit;">UPDATE: Dry bake all the way! There was no noticeable texture difference after using the dry bake method, and it so much easier to bake the cheesecake when you aren't worried about water intrusion into your crust. I'm still struggling with the crack not topping, next time I'll try adding xanthan gum, that is supposed to help.</span></div><div><span style="font-family: inherit;"><br /></span></div><div><span style="font-family: inherit;">Until next time, happy eating!<br /></span>
